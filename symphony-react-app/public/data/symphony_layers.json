    "summary": "This raster data intends to show bird density in coastal areas around the Swedish coast. The source data is voluntary observational statistics exported to an excel file from SLU Artdatabanken (species database) via Analysisportal.se and these data have been converted to density data (average numbers of individual birds reported between May and June within 5km of each grid cell over the period 2010-2017). These data are based on voluntary reporting and are therefore subject to observer bias. Areas without sightings are not reported and areas where many reports are made may be visited by multiple observers. As a consequence these data should be treated cautiously. A cell value of zero represents no reported observation of birds a cell value of 100 represents the maximum observed species diversity at the Beijershamn nature reserve in Öland. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only\nadvisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",

Denna data är baserat på frivillig rapportering och kan därför variera i kontinuitet. Områden utan observationer rapporteras inte och områden där många rapporter gjorts kan ha besökt av flera observatörer. Följaktligen bör dessa data behandlas med försiktighet. Ett cellvärde av 0 motsvarar inga rapporterade fågelobservationer, ett cellvärde av 100 motsvarar den maximala observerade fågeltätheten vid Beijershamns naturreservat på Öland. Denna data skapades som ett data input layer för ’Symphony’ verktyget utvecklat av enheten för havsplaneringen på Havs- och vattenmyndigheten (HaV). Symphony används av HaV för bedömning av den kumulativa miljöpåverkan av mänsklig aktivitet i svenska vatten och används vid havsplanering.

      "improvement_justification": "The layer explicitly states significant limitations due to voluntary reporting and observer bias, which fundamentally affect the data's reliability for assessing bird density. The recommendation to 'correct observer bias if such data exist (i.e. map survey intensity and divide observation reports by the number of observations)' points to a need for a fundamental methodological overhaul to account for data collection effort, which is a major improvement. The current 'density' is not a true density but rather a reporting frequency, heavily influenced by human presence. Addressing this requires a re-conceptualization of how 'density' is derived from biased observational data.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended correction for observer bias would be difficult. It requires determining if 'null data are recorded' and if 'observation density data are available', which implies accessing and integrating additional, potentially unstandardized, datasets from the source (SLU Artdatabanken/Analysisportal.se). If such data are not readily available, it would necessitate a new data collection strategy or a complex statistical modeling approach to infer survey effort, which is a significant undertaking. This goes beyond simple data updates or minor methodological tweaks.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing cannot directly help generate or improve this layer. The layer is about bird density, which is a biological observation. Satellites cannot directly observe individual birds or bird populations at the resolution and specificity required for this layer. While satellites can provide environmental context (e.g., habitat mapping, water quality), they cannot replace the in-situ biological observations that form the basis of this dataset. The core issue is observer bias in biological reporting, not environmental parameters measurable by satellite.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden's primary datasets (Sentinel-2 Level-2A and national land cover data) are not suitable for directly generating or improving this layer. These datasets are focused on land cover, land use, and some shallow water characteristics. They cannot detect or count birds, nor can they provide information on human observation effort or bias in biological reporting. While coastal habitat mapping might be possible with Sentinel-2, it would not address the fundamental data quality issues related to bird observations and observer bias."

These were used to calculate proportional population densities for defined inventory sectoral areas. For each species the observed abundance was divided by the survey area sector to produce areal abundance data. This areal abundance layer was then divided by the species' total population to give a proportional value relative to the species as a whole. The total populations used were: Common Eider: 515 000, Common Scoter: 412 000, Long-Tailed Duck: 1 482 000, Velvet Scoter: 373 000. Finally, data for each of the five species were aggregated into a single layer where the highest proportional value from any of these species was attributed to each sector. In order to capture the full spatial range of the seabirds including areas of peripheral importance this aggregated species density dataset was normalised using a transformation (lin100LogxLin01) and rescaled between 0 and 100 in ArcGIS. Consultation on the methodology has taken place between WSP, Lund University and the Swedish Agency for Water and Marine Management.",

In order to attempt to make the data more conservative (i.e. precautionary) the data has been transformed to emphasise areas which have both core are peripheral importance. This approach might reduce some of the observer bias (by increasing the influence of unsurveyed areas) in the interpolation model but the result\nshould be considered to be a conservative estimate of species density.",

The core data (seabird presence/abundance) is not directly observable by current satellite technology. Therefore, satellite data cannot 'generate' this layer, nor can it 'effectively replace or supplement' the primary observational data for seabird counts.

This raster is a spatial model which shows aggregated species density (relative to the total species population size) of Velvet Scoter, Long tailed duck, Common Scoter and Common Eider. It is based on modelled population densities which were produced using environmental data to infer species distributions in unsurveyed areas. These models were based on field surveys undertaken in the Baltic Sea between 2007 and 2009. The highest occurring value between the species has been attributed to each individual cell and a linear transformation was applied so that a cell value of 0 is equivalent to zero abundance (or no data) and a cell value of 100 is equivalent to the maximum [relative] density for any one of these five species. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",

    "lineage": "Data for the Baltic Sea on four species of wintering seabirds (Velvet Scoter, Long tailed duck, Common Scoter, Common Eider) were sourced in the form of modelled raster data from the SOWBAS database (Status of wintering Waterbird populations in the Baltic Sea) as detailed in the report: Waterbird Populations and Pressures in the Baltic Sea, Nordic Council of Ministers, Copenhagen, TemaNord 2011:550 ISBN 978-92-893-2249-2). The source data are from aerial, shore and ship based surveys undertaken between 2007 and 2009 and these data were modelled (using a two step General Additive Model) to predict the species distribution both inside and outside surveyed areas based on environmental predictor variables. The modelled area is limited to the Baltic Sea. The modelled densities are expressed in number / km2 and these data were normalized against the species total population to give the value per cell relative to the species population as a whole. The total populations used were: Common Eider: 515 000, Common Scoter: 412 000, Long- Tailed Duck: 1 482 000, Velvet Scoter: 373 000. Finally, the relative occurrence of the four species was aggregated where the value of the species with the highest relative occurrence was attributed to each cell. In order to capture the full spatial range of the seabirds including areas of peripheral importance this aggregated species density dataset was normalised using a transformation (lin100LogxLin01) and rescaled between 0 and 100 in ArcGIS. Consultation on the methodology has been carried out\nbetween the WSP and the Swedish Agency for Water and\nMarine Management.",

The recommendation is to update it with 'more new input data' and potentially facilitate insight into 'temporal trends'. This requires new data integration, which is a moderate improvement. While the core methodology (GAM) might remain, the input data needs significant refreshing.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Updating the product with new input data would require new field surveys (aerial, shore, ship-based) for the specified seabird species, followed by modeling. This involves significant coordination, resource investment for surveys, and technical expertise for data processing and modeling, placing it in the 'medium' difficulty category. It's not a simple data update from an existing, continuously collected source.",
      "satellite_justification": "This layer models seabird density based on field surveys and environmental data. Seabird distribution and abundance are primarily determined by direct observation (surveys) and their interaction with environmental factors like prey availability, water depth, and ice cover. While some environmental factors (e.g., sea surface temperature, ice cover) can be derived from satellites, the direct observation of seabirds and their specific species-level densities cannot be effectively replaced or directly measured by current satellite remote sensing technologies. Satellite data alone cannot generate or significantly improve the core seabird density information.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden primarily offers Sentinel-2 optical imagery and national land cover data. These datasets are suitable for terrestrial and shallow coastal mapping, land use, and some water quality parameters in clear, shallow waters. They do not provide direct information on seabird populations, their distribution in offshore waters, or the specific environmental variables (e.g., prey fish distribution) that are critical for modeling seabird densities in the open Baltic Sea. Therefore, DigitalEarthSweden data cannot directly generate or significantly improve this specific marine planning layer."

Measured data on oxygen has been interpolated by SMHI into continuous data layers as part of the Swedish contribution to the Emodnet European Marine Data Network and can be downloaded as NetCDF files http://sextant.ifremer.fr/en/web/emodnet_chemistry/catalogue. In addition predictions of oxygen concentrations based on biochemical modelling were also available for the inshore environment and for the offshore environment for the Baltic, More information on SMHIs modelling can be found here: http://www.smhi.se/en/research/research- departments/oceanography/biogeochemical-modelling-1.31327 . SGU data was sourced from their data archive and covers the period 1993 to 2014. Data detailing anoxic or oxic substrate conditions is determined from visual methods, more details of the data collection method can be found in the combined SGU SMHI report from 2008 http://www.smhi.se/polopoly_fs/1.1975!/oceanografi_95%5B1%5D.pdf The data processing followed the following steps: 1. Interpolation of SGU samples using an inverse distance weighting\nalgorithm\n2. Merging of SMHIs inshore model, offshore model for the Baltic and\ninterpolated measurement data using an overlay approach (mosaic) in\nthe order mentioned.\n3. Combination of the SGU interpolation and the SMHI models where\noverlapping using a Mean Average (assuming equal validity in models)\n4. Apply a spatial smoothing filter (mean average over 7km)\n5.

    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "This dataset is created from models based on water column source data from two different time periods (1993-2014 and 1960-2014) and historical sediment data (1950-2014). There is significant temporal variability (both annual and decadal) in oxygen conditions which are not represented in this data product. We combine all the available data with the intention of showing maximum spatial extent of annual average sediment anoxia over the range of all input data (1950-2014). The modelled data from SMHI lack spatial resolution inshore so depth is used as a proxy based on a observed trend of increasing sediment anoxia with depth in SGU's sediment records. Anoxia is also assumed to increase in areas with complex shorelines (due to decreased currents) but there is no data available to confirm this trend.",
    "recommendations_for_data_improvement": "At present there is insufficient data with the descriptive resolution and spatial precision to produce an reliable (i.e. empirically validated) model of current (or even decadal annual average) sediment anoxia conditions. SGU now have an oxygen sensor attached to their camera system which is used to sample water column anoxia. We recommend collection of field sample data detailing oxygen content of the sediment samples along with nutrient and geophysical and geochemical conditions which could lead to a better understanding of the spatial dynamics and therefore enable the production of a spatial models which can use proxies (depth, sediment composition and water column data) to predict benthic conditions and which can be used for model validation. Autonomous field sampling (i.e. data nodes and landers) is a potential solution to better data as technology improves. https://viewintotheblue.com/underwater-science-nodes",

      "improvement_justification": "The layer is explicitly described as an 'unvalidated benthic anoxia risk map' with significant temporal variability not represented. The recommendations call for 'insufficient data with descriptive resolution and spatial precision to produce a reliable (i.e. empirically validated) model' and suggest 'collection of field sample data detailing oxygen content of the sediment samples along with nutrient and geophysical and geochemical conditions' and 'autonomous field sampling'. This indicates a need for fundamental methodological overhaul and new data collection protocols to achieve a validated and more accurate model, moving beyond a 'risk map' to a predictive model.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements, such as extensive new field sampling (sediment oxygen, nutrients, geophysical/geochemical conditions), developing spatial models that use proxies for prediction, and establishing autonomous field sampling, requires significant resources, advanced technical expertise, and extensive coordination. This goes beyond simple data updates or minor methodological refinements.",
      "satellite_justification": "While direct measurement of benthic anoxia is not possible from satellites, satellite remote sensing can provide valuable proxy data or contextual information. For instance, satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) could refine depth data, which is used as a proxy for anoxia. Satellite observations of water column properties (e.g., chlorophyll-a, turbidity, sea surface temperature) could potentially inform biochemical models or identify areas prone to stratification, which can contribute to anoxia. Although not a direct measure, these could contribute to improving the predictive models mentioned in the recommendations.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden, primarily offering Sentinel-2 data and national land cover, has limited direct applicability to improving this specific marine anoxia layer. Sentinel-2's optical capabilities are limited to shallow, clear waters and are not designed for deep-water marine chemistry or benthic conditions. While shoreline complexity is a predictor variable, Sentinel-2's contribution to this specific aspect would be minor compared to the need for in-situ benthic oxygen data and advanced marine modeling. The core data gaps (sediment oxygen, nutrient data, and validation of benthic conditions) cannot be addressed by DigitalEarthSweden's current offerings."

Furthermore, key data sources for cod distribution (catch per unit effort, catch data, and modelled data) are inherently non-satellite. Satellite data alone cannot generate or significantly improve this layer's core information, though some environmental variables for predictive modeling might be partially derived from satellite (e.g., SST). However, the primary data for cod distribution remains non-satellite.",

If valid this approach would likely provide a dataset with a higher descriptive resolution.' This indicates a fundamental limitation in the current data's spatial resolution and a need for a complete shift from aggregated observational data to a predictive modeling approach, which constitutes a major improvement.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing predictive modeling using environmental variables, as recommended, requires significant expertise in ecological modeling, data integration from various sources (environmental variables), and validation. While not 'new methodology of large complexity with no established techniques', it's a substantial undertaking beyond simple data updates or minor methodological tweaks, placing it in the 'medium' difficulty category.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can provide crucial environmental variables for predictive modeling of marine species distribution. Parameters like Sea Surface Temperature (SST), chlorophyll-a (an indicator of primary productivity and thus food availability), and potentially sea surface height anomalies (related to currents and upwelling) are all derivable from satellite observations and are highly relevant for modeling fish distribution. While herring distribution itself isn't directly observable by satellite, the environmental factors influencing it are.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden primarily offers Sentinel-2 data and national land cover. Sentinel-2 is an optical sensor primarily for land and shallow coastal waters, and its capabilities are limited for deep-water marine environmental parameters like SST or chlorophyll-a, which are critical for herring distribution modeling. The national land cover data is irrelevant for this marine species layer. Therefore, DigitalEarthSweden's current offerings are not directly applicable to generating or improving this specific marine layer."

      "improvement_justification": "While 'No limitations identified' and 'No recommendations suggested' are stated by SLU, the lineage reveals that the data are based on presence data from 1952-2015 for only a few specific species (Salmon, Trout, Eel, Sea Lamprey). The layer aims to show 'predicted diversity of river mouth fish species', but the underlying data are limited to presence of only four species. This suggests a significant gap between the layer's stated purpose (diversity) and its actual data basis (presence of a few species). Expanding the species base to truly represent 'diversity' would be a moderate improvement. Additionally, the temporal period ends in 2015, suggesting a need for updating with more recent data.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Expanding the species base to genuinely represent 'diversity' would require integrating new data sources for other river mouth fish species, which could involve new sampling programs or accessing different biological databases. This is more complex than simply updating existing data. Updating the temporal coverage (post-2015) for the current species would be low difficulty, but the broader goal of representing 'diversity' makes it medium difficulty due to the need for new data integration and potentially new methodologies for diversity prediction.",
      "satellite_justification": "The layer is based on in-situ presence data of specific fish species. Satellite remote sensing cannot directly detect fish species or their diversity. While satellites can provide environmental parameters (e.g., water quality, temperature, coastal habitat) that might influence fish distribution, they cannot generate the core 'presence data' or 'diversity' information for these specific fish species. The data are fundamentally biological and require direct sampling or observation.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden primarily offers Sentinel-2 optical imagery and national land cover data. These datasets are useful for mapping coastal land use, habitat types, and water clarity in shallow areas. However, they cannot directly provide presence data for specific fish species (Salmon, Trout, Eel, Sea Lamprey) or assess their diversity. The core data for this layer are biological observations, which are not within the scope of DigitalEarthSweden's current offerings."

    "summary": "The raster layer intends to show the predicted distribution of Sprat in Swedish marine waters. A cell value of 0 is equivalent to zero abundance and a cell value of 100 is equivalent to high relative abundance. Underlying data are from two sources and consist of acoustic density data (fish /area) and catch data (landings 2010-2015) from commercial fishing. The raster provides a good indication of fish distribution for each ICES rectangle however uncertainty is considerably higher for each 250 m cell as the data provides no information on spatial variation within ICES rectangles. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",

Underliggande data härrör från två källor och består av data från akustikstudier (fisk/område) och\nfångstdata (2010-2015) från kommersiellt fiske. Rastret ger\nen god indikation på fiskdistribution inom varje ICES-\nrektangel, men osäkerheten är avsevärt högre för varje 250\nm-cell eftersom denna data inte ger någon information om\nrumslig variation inom ICES-rektanglar. Denna data\nskapades som ett data input layer för ’Symphony’ verktyget\nutvecklat av enheten för havsplaneringen på Havs- och\nvattenmyndigheten (HaV). Symphony används av HaV för\nbedömning av den kumulativa miljöpåverkan av mänsklig\naktivitet i svenska vatten och används vid havsplanering.\nÅteranvändning av denna data för andra ändamål är endast\nlämpligt efter vägledning och rådgivning av datakällorna.",

      "improvement_justification": "The recommendation explicitly states that 'Predictive modelling of Vendace using relevant environmental variables may be possible. If valid this approach would likely provide a dataset with a higher descriptive resolution.' This suggests a fundamental shift from interpolated catch data to a predictive model, which constitutes a major methodological overhaul and a significant improvement in resolution and potentially accuracy, moving beyond simple interpolation of historical landings.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing predictive modeling, while a significant improvement, is a well-established technique in marine science. It would require identifying relevant environmental variables, potentially integrating new datasets, and developing or applying statistical/machine learning models. This is a 'medium' difficulty task, requiring expertise and resources but not entirely new, unproven methodologies.",
      "satellite_justification": "The underlying data for this layer is commercial fishing catch data (landings). Vendace distribution is likely influenced by environmental factors such as water temperature, salinity, and prey availability. While satellites can measure some environmental variables (e.g., sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a), they cannot directly measure Vendace abundance or catch data. Furthermore, the recommendation is for 'predictive modelling of Vendace using relevant environmental variables', and while some of these variables could be satellite-derived, the core data (Vendace presence/abundance) is not directly observable by satellite. The current layer is based on in-situ catch data, which satellites cannot replicate.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden primarily offers Sentinel-2 optical data and national land cover data. These datasets are suitable for terrestrial and shallow coastal mapping, land use, and some water quality parameters in clear, shallow waters. Vendace are a marine fish species, and their distribution is not directly observable or inferable from Sentinel-2 or land cover data. DigitalEarthSweden does not provide the oceanographic or biological data necessary to generate or improve a Vendace distribution layer, especially one based on catch data or requiring predictive modeling of marine species."

      "improvement_justification": "The layer explicitly states 'very high uncertainty' and 'does not show migration routes outside of the coastal areas' due to a 'large lack of knowledge/information on Eels'. This indicates a fundamental data gap and methodological limitation that requires substantial new data collection (e.g., tracking studies, broader survey efforts) and potentially a complete re-conceptualization of how migration routes are predicted, moving beyond simple interpolated catch data. This goes beyond minor updates or integrating existing data.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Addressing the 'large lack of knowledge/information on Eels' and extending predictions beyond coastal areas would require significant resources for new data collection (e.g., acoustic telemetry, genetic studies, oceanographic modeling for larval transport), advanced biological modeling techniques, and extensive coordination among research institutions. This is a major scientific challenge, not just a data processing task.",
      "satellite_justification": "Eel migration, particularly the oceanic phase, is primarily a biological phenomenon driven by internal cues and ocean currents. While satellites can provide oceanographic parameters like sea surface temperature and currents, these are indirect and insufficient to map specific migration routes of a highly mobile, subsurface organism like the eel. Direct observation or tracking of eels is not possible with current satellite technology. The underlying data are coastal catch data, which satellites cannot directly observe or improve upon for this specific purpose.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden's primary datasets (Sentinel-2 optical imagery and national land cover) are focused on terrestrial and shallow coastal environments. Eel migration, especially the crucial oceanic phase, occurs in deep waters and involves biological processes not detectable by these optical sensors. The data provided by DigitalEarthSweden would not contribute to understanding or mapping eel migration routes, nor would it improve the underlying coastal catch data."

    "summary": "The raster layer intends to show a general picture of important areas for commercial fish spawning in Swedish marine waters. A cell value of 0 is equivalent to no economic value for spawning and a cell value of 100 is equivalent to the highest economic value of spawning species. Underlying data are from two sources and consist of a depth model combined with the spawning area and spawning depth data of commercial fish species. This raster shows a measure of economic value by space based on the ratio between the economic value of each species and its calculated spawning area, summed for all species with an economic value> 100k per year for each marine plan area. The data were normalised on a linear scale for each plan area so a cell value of 100 on the West coast (North Sea) plan area equates to 25 species whereas on the East coast (Baltic) plan area it equates to 12 species and in the Northern plan area (Bottniskaviken) it equates to 5 species. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",

Ett cellvärde av 0 motsvarar ingen fisklek, och ett cellvärde av 100 motsvarar hög relativ fisklek hos kommersiella fiskarter. Underlagsdata härrör från två källor och består av en djupmodell kombinerat med lekområdes- och lekdjupdata över kommersiella fiskarter. Denna data visar ett mått på ekonomiskt värde per ytenhet baserad på kvoten mellan varje arts ekonomiska värde och dess beräknade lekarea, summerad för alla arter med ett ekonomiskt värde > 100 kkr per år för varje havsområde Data normaliseras på en linjär skala för varje område, ett cellvärde av 100 på västkusten (Nordsjön) motsvarar 25 arter, medan samma värde på östkusten (Östersjön) motsvarar 12 arter och i Bottniska viken motsvarar värdet 5 arter. Denna data skapades som ett data input layer för ’Symphony’ verktyget utvecklat av enheten för\nhavsplaneringen på Havs- och vattenmyndigheten (HaV).\nSymphony används av HaV för bedömning av den\nkumulativa miljöpåverkan av mänsklig aktivitet i svenska\nvatten och används vid havsplanering.

While satellite remote sensing can provide bathymetry in shallow waters (Satellite-Derived Bathymetry), the core data for this layer (fish spawning areas, species-specific depth preferences, and economic value) are derived from biological databases and economic assessments, which are not directly observable or derivable from satellite imagery. Satellite data cannot directly identify fish spawning grounds or their economic value. The recommendation to add 'nursery grounds' also relies on biological and habitat data not directly from satellites.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden primarily offers Sentinel-2 optical data and national land cover data. These are useful for terrestrial and shallow coastal mapping (e.g., substrate mapping in very clear, shallow waters, or coastal land use), but they do not provide the biological data on fish spawning or nursery grounds, nor the economic valuation data, which are central to this layer. While the SGU substrate map (mentioned in the recommendation) might be related to seabed characteristics, DigitalEarthSweden's capabilities are not directly applicable to generating or significantly improving the core biological and economic aspects of this marine fish spawning layer."

Underlying data are from two sources and consist of Surface Area Ratio (SAR) of trawling (OSPAR 2009-2013, and HELCOM 2009-2015) data. A cell value of 0 is equivalent to no benthic abrasion by bottom trawling and a cell value of 100 is equivalent to abrasion (SAR ≥ 8.196288). The surface area ratios (SAR) of trawling are produced by summing total swept area of trawling within a measurement area and then normalize the swept area to the measurement area. Assuming that within the measurement area the trawling is evenly distributed the surface area ratio is interpreted as the number of times per unit of time the measurement area is trawled over. The swept area for a specific fishing vessel is estimated using modelled trawl door spread (for a specific fishery/gear) multiplied by the vms (vessel monitoring system) speed and vms ping interval for a vms signal/position representing benthic trawling. The total swept area within a measurement area is then the sum of all swept area positions, from all vessels within a measurement area. For these data a logarithmic relationship between trawl intensity SAR and benthic impact due to abrasion is assumed, however habitat specific susceptibility to trawling is not modelled so this is a simplistic assumption. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",

    "lineage": "Data are internationally collected data on bottom trawling impact produced by the ICES working group on spatial fisheries data (ICES WGSFD). Standardized products on surface area ratio (SAR) of trawling were downloaded from the working group link on ICES homepage. The method is described in the working group reports (ICES Working Group Spatial Fisheries Data report 2016), but in short the SAR of trawling are produced by summing total swept area of trawling within a measurement area and then normalize the swept area to the measurement area. Assuming that within the measurement area the trawling is evenly distributed the SAR is interpreted as the number of times per unit of time the measurement area is trawled over. The swept area for a specific fishing vessel is estimated using modelled trawl door spread (for a specific fishery/gear) multiplied by the vms speed and vms ping interval for a vms signal/position representing fishery. The total swept area within a measurement area is then the sum of all swept area\npositions, from all vessels within a measurement area.\nThe underlying data has been aggregated yearly on a\ngeographic grid of resolution 0.05 degree (approximately 1.5\nx 3 nm square at 57 N). Yearly data on total SAR are\nproduced in the HELCOM (the Baltic including Kattegat)\nand OSPAR (North East Atlantic incl. Kattegat) region\nrespectively. Data are available for the years 2009 – 2013 in\nthe HELCOM region and 2009-2015 in the OSPAR region.\nData are available as spatial polygons.\nEach year’s polygon dataset were projected into the\nSymphony projection ETRS1989 LAEA. Further the\npolygons were rasterized on the symphony grid using mean\nvalues if several polygons overlay the same raster grid cell.\nAverages of SAR values are calculated (introducing zero\nvalues in NA raster cells) over the time periods (2009-2015\nfor OSPAR and 2009-2013 for HELCOM) and the Kattegat\narea where masked from the HELCOM data set. Finally the\ntwo data sets were added and save as\n'Bottom_trawling_intensity_mean_SAR.tif'\nThe raster was normalized by dividing the data set by the\nmaximum SAR value in the Swedish exclusive economic\nzone (EEZ): maxEEZ SAR = 8.196288\nFrom this underlying data set, representing swept area of\nbottom trawlers, a logarithmic response proxy was derived\nrepresenting sedimentation impact from trawling and these\ndata were rescaled on a 0-1 scale.\nUncertainty of this layer is set to 0.5 representing a “good”\nmodel, in the whole region as the data are almost complete\ninternational data (representing vessels >12 m), they are\naverages over several years and thus represent a large part of\nthe total trawling effort and resource outtake but aggregated\ninto larger cells (0.05 degree resolution) and partly\nvalidated. Also compared to traditional proxies for bottom\ntrawling like kW*fishing hours, the SAR values takes into\naccount typical trawl widths for different fishing fleets.",
    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "This bottom impact layer aims to describe the impact of bottom trawling on benthic habitats. This bottom-trawling index is used as a proxy for this impact and a logarithmic relationship between trawl intensity and benthic impact is used. This a is simplified assumption - habitat specific susceptibility to trawling is not modelled.",
    "recommendations_for_data_improvement": "The source data for Symphony should continue to be based on international data. Work should continue to increase the availability of data volumes collected today by ICES within WGSFD. Current available data is not divided into pelagic / demersal species. Official landing statistics per ICES box could be used to weight trawl index for catches per box and,\nfor example, per demersal / pelagic target species.\nNew research (Benthis - 7th Framework Program and Trawling - Best Practice Project) is\ncurrently underway to develop indicators for use in, inter alia, the Marine Directive. These\nproposed indicators are based on a mechanistic link between trawl intensity and habitat\nspecific benthic responses. This are therefore different from previous expert-based\nsensitivity estimates and the benefits of these kind of data have been highlighted in ICES\nadvice. The indicator data being created in the Benthis project will have the advantage of\nbeing normalized to the interval [0.1] and will therefore be suitable for future Symphony\nupdates.\nWork is also ongoing to include not only the direct physical impact (abrasion/mechanical\ndamage) but also sedimentation. Future data products should, if possible, consist of the\ninternationally produced indicators. In order to improve these indicators, it is primarily\nknowledge about habitats and bottom type that should be improved - funding support for\nparticipation in any research and development projects that would help to continue this\ndevelopment are recommended.",

      "improvement_justification": "The layer explicitly states that it uses a 'simplified assumption' of a logarithmic relationship between trawl intensity and benthic impact, and 'habitat specific susceptibility to trawling is not modelled'. The recommendations highlight ongoing research (Benthis project) that aims to develop indicators based on a 'mechanistic link between trawl intensity and habitat specific benthic responses', which would be a fundamental shift from the current expert-based sensitivity estimates. Furthermore, the recommendation to include sedimentation impact in addition to direct physical impact, and to improve knowledge about habitats and bottom type, points to a need for substantial methodological overhaul and new data integration beyond simple updates. This indicates a 'large' improvement potential.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements, such as incorporating habitat-specific susceptibility and mechanistic links, would require significant new research, data collection (e.g., detailed habitat mapping, potentially through in-situ surveys or advanced acoustic methods), and complex modeling. The Benthis project is explicitly mentioned as 'new research' underway, implying that these are not readily available, off-the-shelf solutions. Improving knowledge about habitats and bottom types, and integrating sedimentation impacts, would also be resource-intensive and require advanced technical expertise. This points to a 'high' difficulty level.",
      "satellite_justification": "The layer focuses on benthic abrasion from bottom trawling, which is a physical impact on the seafloor. While satellites can provide some information relevant to marine planning (e.g., sea surface temperature, chlorophyll), they cannot directly measure or monitor bottom trawling abrasion, trawl door spread, or the physical impact on benthic habitats. These require in-situ measurements, VMS data, and potentially acoustic surveys for habitat mapping. Satellite-derived bathymetry has limitations in deeper waters and for detailed habitat characterization needed for this specific layer. Therefore, satellite remote sensing cannot directly generate or significantly improve this layer's core data.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden primarily offers Sentinel-2 optical imagery and national land cover data. Sentinel-2 is limited to terrestrial and shallow coastal waters, and its optical nature means it cannot penetrate deep enough to monitor benthic habitats or bottom trawling impacts in the offshore and deeper coastal waters where trawling occurs. The national land cover data is also terrestrial/coastal focused and not relevant for deep-sea benthic impact assessment. Therefore, DigitalEarthSweden's current offerings cannot help generate or improve this specific marine layer, which requires detailed sub-surface information and VMS data."

      "improvement_justification": "The layer explicitly states a major limitation: 'The surface of the reef can not be read from this substrate.' and recommends 'Gather attribution which can be used to predict the surface area and predict impacts or benefits of habitat change.' This requires a fundamental shift from simple presence/absence to quantitative spatial extent and qualitative assessment of habitat type/quality, which is a significant conceptual and data collection overhaul.",
      "difficulty_justification": "While the improvement is large, the recommendation suggests gathering 'attribution' like 'type of exposed substrates' and 'block form, ph balanced concrete armouring' vs. 'plastic culvert pipe'. This implies a need for more detailed in-situ data collection or integration of more granular existing engineering/construction data, which is feasible but requires coordination and potentially new data acquisition protocols. It's not a 'high' difficulty as it doesn't necessarily require entirely new, unproven methodologies, but it's more than just integrating existing data.",
      "satellite_justification": "The layer focuses on artificial reef structures like bridges, lighthouses, wind turbines, and wrecks. While some large surface structures (bridges, wind turbines) might be visible from high-resolution satellite imagery, the primary limitation is determining the 'surface area of the reef' and the 'type of exposed substrates' or 'quality' of the artificial habitat. Satellite remote sensing, even with high resolution, cannot effectively penetrate water to map the detailed underwater surface area or material composition of these structures, nor can it identify submerged wrecks with the required detail for habitat assessment. This requires in-situ surveys (e.g., acoustic, ROV, diver surveys).",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden's primary offerings (Sentinel-2 and national land cover) are not suitable for addressing the core limitations of this layer. Sentinel-2 is optical and has limited water penetration, making it ineffective for mapping submerged artificial reef surface areas or substrate types. The national land cover data is terrestrial. While large coastal structures might be visible, the critical information needed (underwater surface area, material type, habitat quality) cannot be derived from these datasets. The layer's focus is on marine structures and their underwater 'reef effect', which is beyond the capabilities of DigitalEarthSweden's current offerings."

This raster is modelled using morphology metrics calculated from depth data provided by the Swedish Maritime Administration and expert judgement based on comparison with geological surveys undertaken by the Swedish Geological Survey (in areas surveyed by both agencies). A cell value of 0 is equivilent to zero probability of the prescence of hard bottom and a cell value of 100 is equivilent to a high probability of presence. Underlying data are from 'best available' historical data with variable quality: refer to the associated uncertainty layer for for information on data quality. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",

    "lineage": "This dataset was created by combining a range of seabed complexity metrics which were calculated in ArcGIS (with the spatial analyst extension) on a 10m resolution depth model maintained by the Swedish Maritime Agency (SMA). The indata to this analysis are from a 'best available' 10m resolution depth grid known as DIS (depth information system). Although the data are gridded to 10m the it is important to be aware that the input data are of highly varying quality. Refer to the associated map of spatial uncertainty for this layer to understand where major data gaps exist. DIS contains data which can be categorised into three quality classes. The highest quality data are collected using from modern techniques (for example multibeam echosounder surveys) and provide full coverage depth data (this is mostly restricted to shipping lanes), these data are charted to international standards (IHO S-44). The second category of data are those collected using modern techniques but which do not comply with international charting standards (although are still very high resolution for our intended use), they are data collected after 1987 (and therefore have a good positional accuracy) but they may not provide 100% coverage of the seafloor. The final, lower quality class of data are those collected before 1987 from historical chart archives based on data collected using older methods (e.g. single beam echosounders or lead-line surveys). In all classes of data it should be noted that depths may also be subject to a shoal-bias (reduced depths) which is standard practice for reducing potential collision risk in navigational charting. Due to mixing data resolutions data artefacts are likely to be present in the grid at boundaries between high resolution and low resolution surveys. The procedure used to produce the complexity datasets for Symphony were as follows: A) 6 complexity metrics and a hillshade were calculated:\n1. Bathymetric Positioning Index (BPI) with an inner\ndiameter of 10m & outer diameter of 250m,\n2. Bathymetric Positioning Index with ID:10m & OD:50m:\nhttps://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/tools/btm.html\n3. Slope using a 10m grid with ArcGIS spatial analyst.\n4. Slope using a 250m grid (downsampled from the 10m\ngrid) with ArcGIS spatial analyst.\n5. Standard deviation of depth using a neighborhood size of\n5 cells (50m) and the 10m grid with ArcGIS spatial analyst.\n6. Standard deviation of depth using a neighborhood size of\n25cell (250m) and the 10m grid with ArcGIS spatial analyst.\n7. A hillshade layer for visual interpretation\nData were generated using a ArcGIS modelbuilder toolbox\ndeveloped by SGU, and executed by SMA.\nB) All 6 complexity metrics where resampled to a 50m raster\n(mean value) using ArcGIS\nC) BPI metrics (1. and 2.) were stretched using an e log (base\n2,718) function and rescaled between 0 and 10.\nD) Slope and standard deviation metrics were also stretched\nusing an e log function and rescaled between 0 and 10.\nE) A average (MEAN) raster was calcultated by combining\nall the stretched and rescaled metrics from (C & D) .\nF) Raster values between 2.5 and 7.5 in the raster (E) were\nrescaled between 0 and 10 normalising the data to reflect\nhardbottom features.\nG) The resulting dataset was then downsampled from 50m\nto 300m using the maximum value in a 6x6 cell\nneighbourhood.\nH) The result (G) was standardised to the Symphony grid\n250m (nearest neighbour) with no-data set to zero.\nI) The result (H) was normalised by substrating the\nSymphony hardbottom dataset and the result rescaled\nbetween 0 and 100.\nJ) The result (I) was split into 3 depth zones photic, and\naphotic below & aphotic above 60m",
    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "There are some key limitations to be aware of when using these data: 1) Although this data product is based on the best available depth data - these depth data are of variable quality. In some areas there are even no data available: for example the area around Bratten Bohuslän coast. For further information on depth data uncertainty refer to\nthe confidence map associated with this dataset.\n2) The model is based on data with a minimum mapping unit of 50m. This is not detailed\nenough to pick out smaller depth / morphology variations and a consequence the dataset\nmay not help in the identification of certain geological features (e.g. sparse boulders on a flat\nlandscape) which may be important or sensitive habitat.\n3) This dataset is intended to be used as a proxy for hard bottom bethic habitat (i.e.\nidentifying areas where SGUs geological survey data are unavailable) however this refers to\nmorphological complexity (and light penetration) and does not consider geological\nsubstrate. Therefore areas which are 'complex' in terms of morphology may not always be\nhard bottom.\n4) Normalisation to reflect 'hard bottom' features was undertaken by visual comparison with\nSymphony 'hard bottom' data - i.e. derived from SGUs geological maps. However, a perfect\nmatch between complexity and hardbottom is not possible using expert judgement.\n5) These data are currently only available for Sweden.",
    "recommendations_for_data_improvement": "Further data collection is requied in areas with no data or low quality data. Rather than using two separate habitat proxy datasets in Symphony - morphological complexity (modelled from depth) and hardbottom (modelled from geological maps) the data on complexity should instead be used to drive a predictive model of substrate in combination with other physical predictor variables (such as currents & wave exposure) and ground validation data from point obserations. This work is in progress at SGU. This approach demonstrates a great deal of potential for improvement of national geological datasets. It is therefore reccomended that the approach is extended to surrounding countries (perhaps via international collaboration projects like Emodnet).",

This represents a major methodological overhaul and a move from a proxy to a more direct predictive approach, indicating 'large' improvement potential. Furthermore, there's a clear need for new data collection in areas with no or low-quality data.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing a new predictive model for substrate, integrating multiple physical variables, and requiring ground validation data is a complex undertaking. It involves advanced modeling techniques, potentially new data collection campaigns (as recommended), and significant coordination, especially if extended to surrounding countries. This aligns with 'high' difficulty.",
      "satellite_justification": "While the primary data for this layer is bathymetry, satellite remote sensing can contribute to improving the predictive model recommended. Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) could potentially fill some data gaps in shallow, clear waters, especially in areas where traditional survey data are sparse or low quality. Although SDB has limitations in deeper or turbid waters, it could supplement the existing depth data. Furthermore, satellite data could potentially contribute to understanding wave exposure or surface currents, which are recommended as additional predictor variables for the new substrate model. However, it's important to note that satellite data alone cannot fully generate this layer, as it relies heavily on detailed bathymetry and geological ground-truthing.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden, primarily offering Sentinel-2 data and national land cover, has limited direct applicability to this specific marine layer. Sentinel-2's capabilities for bathymetry are restricted to very shallow, clear waters, and it cannot provide the detailed morphological metrics derived from high-resolution echosounder data that form the basis of this layer. The layer focuses on aphotic, deeper waters (up to 60m) where optical satellite penetration is insufficient. While coastal land cover data might be relevant for broader coastal zone management, it does not directly contribute to mapping 'rough bottom aphotic' substrate. Therefore, DigitalEarthSweden's current offerings are not directly suitable for generating or significantly improving this specific marine layer."

    "lineage": "This dataset was created by combining a range of seabed complexity metrics which were calculated in ArcGIS (with the spatial analyst extension) on a 10m resolution depth model maintained by the Swedish Maritime Agency (SMA). The indata to this analysis are from a 'best available' 10m resolution depth grid known as DIS (depth information system). Although the data are gridded to 10m the it is important to be aware that the input data are of highly varying quality. Refer to the associated map of spatial uncertainty for this layer to understand where major data gaps exist. DIS contains data which can be categorised into three quality classes. The highest quality data are collected using from modern techniques (for example multibeam echosounder surveys) and provide full coverage depth data (this is mostly restricted to shipping lanes), these data are charted to international standards (IHO S-44). The second category of data are those collected using modern techniques but which do not comply with international charting standards (although are still very high resolution for our\nintended use), they are data collected after 1987 (and\ntherefore have a good positional accuracy) but they may not\nprovide 100% coverage of the seafloor. The final, lower\nquality class of data are those collected before 1987 from\nhistorical chart archives based on data collected using older\nmethods (e.g. single beam echosounders or lead-line\nsurveys). In all classes of data it should be noted that depths\nmay also be subject to a shoal-bias (reduced depths) which is\nstandard practice for reducing potential collision risk in\nnavigational charting. Due to mixing data resolutions data\nartefacts are likely to be present in the grid at boundaries\nbetween high resolution and low resolution surveys.\nThe procedure used to produce the complexity datasets for\nSymphony were as follows:\nA) 6 complexity metrics and a hillshade were calculated:\n1. Bathymetric Positioning Index (BPI) with an inner\ndiameter of 10m & outer diameter of 250m,\n2. Bathymetric Positioning Index with ID:10m & OD:50m:\nhttps://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/tools/btm.html\n3. Slope using a 10m grid with ArcGIS spatial analyst.\n4. Slope using a 250m grid (downsampled from the 10m\ngrid) with ArcGIS spatial analyst.\n5. Standard deviation of depth using a neighborhood size of\n5 cells (50m) and the 10m grid with ArcGIS spatial analyst.\n6. Standard deviation of depth using a neighborhood size of\n25cell (250m) and the 10m grid with ArcGIS spatial analyst.\n7. A hillshade layer for visual interpretation\nData were generated using a ArcGIS modelbuilder toolbox\ndeveloped by SGU, and executed by SMA.\nB) All 6 complexity metrics where resampled to a 50m raster\n(mean value) using ArcGIS\nC) BPI metrics (1. and 2.) were stretched using an e log (base\n2,718) function and rescaled between 0 and 10.\nD) Slope and standard deviation metrics were also stretched\nusing an e log function and rescaled between 0 and 10.\nE) A average (MEAN) raster was calcultated by combining\nall the stretched and rescaled metrics from (C & D) .\nF) Raster values between 2.5 and 7.5 in the raster (E) were\nrescaled between 0 and 10 normalising the data to reflect\nhardbottom features. G) The resulting dataset was then downsampled from 50m\nto 300m using the maximum value in a 6x6 cell\nneighbourhood.\nH) The result (G) was standardised to the Symphony grid\n250m (nearest neighbour) with no-data set to zero.\nI) The result (H) was normalised by substrating the\nSymphony hardbottom dataset and the result rescaled\nbetween 0 and 100.\nJ) The result (I) was split into 3 depth zones photic, and\naphotic below & aphotic above 60m",
    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "There are some key limitations to be aware of when using these data: 1) Although this data product is based on the best available depth data - these depth data are of variable quality. In some areas there are even no data available: for example the area around Bratten Bohuslän coast. For further information on depth data uncertainty refer to the confidence map associated with this dataset. 2) The model is based on data with a minimum mapping unit of 50m. This is not detailed enough to pick out smaller depth / morphology variations and a consequence the dataset may not help in the identification of certain geological features (e.g. sparse boulders on a flat landscape) which may be important or sensitive habitat. 3) This dataset is intended to be used as a proxy for hard bottom bethic habitat (i.e. identifying areas where SGUs geological survey data are unavailable) however this refers to morphological complexity (and light penetration) and does not consider geological substrate. Therefore areas which are 'complex' in terms of morphology may not always be hard bottom. 4) Normalisation to reflect 'hard bottom' features was undertaken by visual comparison with Symphony 'hard bottom' data - i.e. derived from SGUs geological maps. However, a perfect match between complexity and hardbottom is not possible using expert judgement. 5) These data are currently only available for Sweden.",
    "recommendations_for_data_improvement": "Further data collection is requied in areas with no data or low quality data. Rather than using two separate habitat proxy datasets in Symphony - morphological complexity (modelled from depth) and hardbottom (modelled from geological maps) the data on complexity should instead be used to drive a predictive model of substrate in combination with other physical predictor variables (such as currents & wave exposure) and ground validation data from point obserations. This work is in progress at SGU. This approach demonstrates a great deal of potential for improvement of national geological datasets. It is therefore reccomended that the approach is extended to surrounding countries (perhaps via international collaboration projects like Emodnet).",

This is a shift from a proxy based on morphology to a predictive model of substrate, which constitutes a major improvement. Additionally, there's a need for 'further data collection in areas with no data or low quality data' and extending the approach to surrounding countries, indicating substantial new data collection and expansion.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended predictive model of substrate requires 'combining with other physical predictor variables (such as currents & wave exposure) and ground validation data from point observations', which implies advanced modeling techniques and significant data integration. The work is 'in progress at SGU', suggesting it's not a simple update. Extending the approach to surrounding countries via 'international collaboration projects like Emodnet' also points to extensive coordination and resource investment.",
      "satellite_justification": "While the layer focuses on deep aphotic water, satellite remote sensing can contribute to improving the 'predictive model of substrate' recommended. Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) could potentially improve the underlying depth data in shallower, clear waters, especially in areas with 'no data available' or 'low quality data' as mentioned in the limitations. Although SDB has depth limitations, it could provide valuable input for the 'best available' depth model, particularly in coastal areas. Additionally, satellite data on sea surface temperature or currents (though not directly for deep bottom) could potentially inform models of water column dynamics that influence substrate, or be used as proxy for wave exposure in coastal areas. However, the primary focus of this layer (deep aphotic hard bottom) is not directly observable by satellite.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden, primarily offering Sentinel-2 optical data and national land cover, is not directly applicable to improving this layer. The layer focuses on 'deep (>60m) aphotic water areas' and 'hard bottom' substrate. Sentinel-2's water depth penetration is limited to clear, shallow waters, and it lacks specialized oceanographic sensors for deep-water bathymetry or substrate characterization. The national land cover data is terrestrial/coastal and not relevant for deep marine environments. Therefore, DigitalEarthSweden's current offerings cannot directly help generate or improve this specific deep-water layer."

    "lineage": "This dataset was created by combining a range of seabed complexity metrics which were calculated in ArcGIS (with the spatial analyst extension) on a 10m resolution depth\nmodel maintained by the Swedish Maritime Agency (SMA).\nThe indata to this analysis are from a 'best available' 10m\nresolution depth grid known as DIS (depth information\nsystem). Although the data are gridded to 10m the it is\nimportant to be aware that the input data are of highly\nvarying quality. Refer to the associated map of spatial\nuncertainty for this layer to understand where major data\ngaps exist.\nDIS contains data which can be categorised into three\nquality classes. The highest quality data are collected using\nfrom modern techniques (for example multibeam\nechosounder surveys) and provide full coverage depth data\n(this is mostly restricted to shipping lanes), these data are\ncharted to international standards (IHO S-44). The second\ncategory of data are those collected using modern techniques\nbut which do not comply with international charting\nstandards (although are still very high resolution for our\nintended use), they are data collected after 1987 (and\ntherefore have a good positional accuracy) but they may not\nprovide 100% coverage of the seafloor. The final, lower\nquality class of data are those collected before 1987 from\nhistorical chart archives based on data collected using older\nmethods (e.g. single beam echosounders or lead-line\nsurveys). In all classes of data it should be noted that depths\nmay also be subject to a shoal-bias (reduced depths) which is\nstandard practice for reducing potential collision risk in\nnavigational charting. Due to mixing data resolutions data\nartefacts are likely to be present in the grid at boundaries\nbetween high resolution and low resolution surveys.\nThe procedure used to produce the complexity datasets for\nSymphony were as follows:\nA) 6 complexity metrics and a hillshade were calculated:\n1. Bathymetric Positioning Index (BPI) with an inner\ndiameter of 10m & outer diameter of 250m,\n2. Bathymetric Positioning Index with ID:10m & OD:50m:\nhttps://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/tools/btm.html\n3. Slope using a 10m grid with ArcGIS spatial analyst.\n4. Slope using a 250m grid (downsampled from the 10m\ngrid) with ArcGIS spatial analyst.\n5. Standard deviation of depth using a neighborhood size of\n5 cells (50m) and the 10m grid with ArcGIS spatial analyst.\n6. Standard deviation of depth using a neighborhood size of\n25cell (250m) and the 10m grid with ArcGIS spatial analyst. 7. A hillshade layer for visual interpretation\nData were generated using a ArcGIS modelbuilder toolbox\ndeveloped by SGU, and executed by SMA.\nB) All 6 complexity metrics where resampled to a 50m raster\n(mean value) using ArcGIS\nC) BPI metrics (1. and 2.) were stretched using an e log (base\n2,718) function and rescaled between 0 and 10.\nD) Slope and standard deviation metrics were also stretched\nusing an e log function and rescaled between 0 and 10.\nE) A average (MEAN) raster was calcultated by combining\nall the stretched and rescaled metrics from (C & D) .\nF) Raster values between 2.5 and 7.5 in the raster (E) were\nrescaled between 0 and 10 normalising the data to known\nhardbottom features.\nG) The resulting dataset was then downsampled from 50m\nto 300m using the maximum value in a 6x6 cell\nneighbourhood.\nH) The result (G) was standardised to the Symphony grid\n250m (nearest neighbour) with no-data set to zero.\nI) The result (H) was further normalised by substrating the\nSymphony hardbottom dataset and rescaling between 0 and\n100.\nJ) The result (I) was split into 3 depth zones photic, and\naphotic below & aphotic above 60m",
    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "There are some key limitations to be aware of when using these data: 1) Although this data product is based on the best available depth data - these depth data are of variable quality. In some areas there are even no data available: for example the area around Bratten Bohuslän coast. For further information on depth data uncertainty refer to the confidence map associated with this dataset. 2) The model is based on data with a minimum mapping unit of 50m. This is not detailed enough to pick out smaller depth / morphology variations and a consequence the dataset may not help in the identification of certain geological features (e.g. sparse boulders on a flat landscape) which may be important or sensitive habitat. 3) This dataset is intended to be used as a proxy for hard bottom bethic habitat (i.e. identifying areas where SGUs geological survey data are unavailable) however this refers to morphological complexity (and light penetration) and does not consider geological substrate. Therefore areas which are 'complex' in terms of morphology may not always be hard bottom. 4) Normalisation to reflect 'hard bottom' features was undertaken by visual comparison with Symphony 'hard bottom' data - i.e. derived from SGUs geological maps. However, a perfect match between complexity and hardbottom is not possible using expert judgement. 5) These data are currently only available for Sweden.",
    "recommendations_for_data_improvement": "Further data collection is requied in areas with no data or low quality data. Rather than using two separate habitat proxy datasets in Symphony - morphological complexity (modelled from depth) and hardbottom (modelled from geological maps) the data on complexity should instead be used to drive a predictive model of substrate in combination with other physical predictor variables (such as currents & wave exposure) and ground validation data from point obserations. This work is in progress at SGU. This approach demonstrates a great deal of potential for improvement of national geological datasets. It is therefore reccomended that the approach is extended to surrounding countries (perhaps via international collaboration projects like Emodnet).",

      "improvement_justification": "The recommendations explicitly suggest a fundamental methodological overhaul: moving from using morphological complexity as a proxy for hard bottom to developing a predictive model of substrate that combines morphology with other physical predictor variables (currents, wave exposure) and ground validation data. This is a 'work in progress at SGU' and represents a significant shift from the current approach, aiming for a 'great deal of potential for improvement of national geological datasets'. This aligns with the 'large' improvement criteria of 'fundamental methodological overhauls' and 'requiring advanced modeling techniques not currently used'.",
      "difficulty_justification": "The recommendation involves developing a 'predictive model of substrate' combining multiple physical predictor variables and ground validation, which is described as 'work in progress at SGU'. This implies significant research and development, advanced technical expertise in predictive modeling, and extensive data integration. Extending this approach to 'surrounding countries (perhaps via international collaboration projects like Emodnet)' further indicates a high level of coordination and resource investment. This aligns with the 'high' difficulty criteria of 'requires significant resources, advanced technical expertise, extensive coordination, or major infrastructure' and 'a new methodology of large complexity with no established techniques' (in the context of a fully operational, validated, and extended model).",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can contribute to improving this layer, particularly in generating or enhancing some of the 'other physical predictor variables' mentioned in the recommendations (e.g., currents, wave exposure). While direct 'hard bottom' mapping is challenging, satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) could potentially improve the underlying depth data in shallow, clear waters, especially in areas with 'no data available' or 'low quality data' as highlighted in the limitations. Satellite data can also provide insights into water clarity, which influences light penetration (photic zone definition). Although not directly mapping hard bottom, these indirect contributions can feed into a more robust predictive model.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden, through its Sentinel-2 Level-2A data products, can contribute to improving this layer, particularly in shallow coastal areas. While Sentinel-2 cannot directly map deep hard bottom, it can be used for satellite-derived bathymetry in clear, shallow waters, potentially filling some of the 'no data available' gaps or improving the resolution of depth data in the photic zone. Its capabilities for coastal habitat mapping and land cover can also provide contextual information that might indirectly support the development of a more comprehensive predictive model, especially concerning coastal processes that influence substrate. However, its utility is limited to the photic zone and clear waters, and it cannot provide the full range of physical predictor variables needed for the recommended predictive model."

Various tools and internal developed models were used in ArcMap 10.3 to produce the final data such as Dissolve, Point to Raster, Polygon to Raster, Raster calculator and Water Ways model 1.02 (Aquabiota AB model). The method is a simple GIS-model that aims to extrapolate lophelia and porifera distributions based on presence point density and distance between point through water ways. This model does not take into account any environmental variables The model groups presence samples if they are within 1500 m distance through water ways and therefore the entire buffered grouped area becomes an expected distribution area. Expected distribution area is represented with value 100 in raster file. Another condition is needed to be fulfilled to form an expected lophelia distribution area which is the samples density need to be three or more than three samples and they need to be at least 125 m away from each other. The radius 1500 m is selected based on average sampling spatial distribution across the Swedish water body and therefore it is most likely to group samples in a more considerable way than other radius distances. The second condition distance is selected based on cell size distance which is 250 m. It is set 125 m with the reason of being half of the cell size distance and therefore aims to eliminate points that might be on the same raster cell that could lead to a false creation of expected bivalvia distribution area. The samples density three or more than three is selected based on average sampling spatial distribution within the area with the radius 1500 m. All sampling points that do not fulfil those two conditions are represented as only one cell with the value 100. More detailed information on the lineage and methodology is available and can be supplied on request to the data owner.",

It is based on data sourced from Helsingborg Municipal Council and the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute's SHARK (\"Svenskt HavsARKiv\") database. No prediction is made of where these communities might exist in unsurveyed areas. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",

      "improvement_justification": "The layer explicitly states it's an underestimate due to reliance on observational data and 'no prediction is made'. The recommendation is to improve sampling and 'possibly enable a more advanced modelling' which would require 'better data on abiotic parameters'. This indicates a fundamental shift from purely observational mapping to predictive modeling, which is a major overhaul.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing predictive modeling for a species like Haploops requires significant effort. It involves 'improved sampling efforts' (new data collection), and gathering 'better data on abiotic parameters (depth, water chemistry, currents and geology)' which are complex and resource-intensive. Developing and validating a reliable predictive model is also a high-difficulty task, especially for a benthic species.",
      "satellite_justification": "Haploops are benthic organisms, meaning they live on the seafloor. Satellite remote sensing primarily captures surface or near-surface phenomena (e.g., SST, chlorophyll, surface currents, turbidity). While satellites can provide some broad environmental context (e.g., water clarity in very shallow areas, which might indirectly relate to benthic habitats), they cannot directly detect or monitor Haploops reefs or the specific abiotic parameters (e.g., seafloor geology, specific water chemistry at depth, bottom currents) required for their predictive modeling. In-situ measurements, biological sampling, and potentially acoustic methods are necessary.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden, primarily offering Sentinel-2 optical data and national land cover, is not suitable for directly detecting or modeling Haploops reefs. Sentinel-2 has limited water penetration, especially in coastal and offshore waters where Haploops are found, and cannot provide the necessary abiotic parameters like depth, water chemistry, or bottom currents. Its focus is largely terrestrial and shallow coastal, not deep enough or with the right sensor capabilities for benthic marine life or the specific environmental variables needed for predictive modeling of Haploops."

However, a power analysis was not undertaken to ensure sufficient sample availability for each surface substrate class and there is a significant range in replicate numbers between classes. 3) Where insufficient sample replication occurred to enable classification by depth, sea area and map scale data were averaged across depth ranges and between sea areas so certain classes are more reliable than others. 4) Surface substrates which form a veneer cover a smaller area of the seabed and consequently for some classes insufficient replicates were available for analysis.

The first is a predictive spatial model of areas with at least 10% cover of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) which utilises environmental data parameters to predict distribution in unsurveyed areas. The second is a simple spatial model of bivalve distribution based on observational data and proximity information. These two source datasets are binary data. They have been aggregated with a higher weight given to the bivalve dataset. A value of 0 in the combined dataset represents areas where no blue mussels are predicted and where no bivalve observations exist, a value of 100 represents areas where (or in close proximity to where) bivalves have been observed. A value of 30 represents areas where >10% cover of blue mussels are predicted (but where no observational data exists). No prediction is made of where bivalves (other than blue mussels) might exist in unsurveyed areas. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area\nscales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only\nadvisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",
    "summary_swedish": "Detta rasterskikt avser att visa distribution av musselrevshabitat i svenska kust- och havsvatten. rasterskiktet härstammar från två inputs-rasterskikt. Den första är en prediktiv, rumslig modell av områden med minst 10 % täckning av blåmusslor (Mytilus Edulis) som använder miljödataparametrar för att förutsäga distribution i ej undersökta områden. Den andra är en enkel rumslig modell av musseldistribution baserad på observationsdata och proximitet. Dessa två källrasterskikt är binära data. De är aggregerade med större vikt lagd vid musselrasterskiktet. Ett värde av 0 i det kombinerade rasterskiktet motsvarar områden där inga blåmusslor förutspås förekomma och ingen observation av musslor finns, ett värde av 100 motsvarar ett område (eller i närheten av) där musslor har observerats. Ett värde av 30 representerar områden där > 10 % täckning av blåmusslor förväntas (men ingen observationsdata finns). Ingen förutsägelse görs om musslor (förutom blåmusslor) kan finnas i ej undersökta områden.

    "lineage": "This layer was created by combining a predictive model of blue mussel distribution (mytilus edilus) with presence data of bivalves (including Macoma balthica, Cerastoderma glaucum, Arctica islandica, Modiolus modiolus). These data were combined by the SGU at the request of SwAM using a conditional statement in ArcGIS 10.3 Raster Calculator so that sites with observational records are given a value of 100 and sites with a prediction are given a value of 30. The first input layer for mytilus edulis was modelled using epibenthos data from SHARK (source: SMHI), where there are blue mussel observational records detailing % cover ranging from 0 to 100%. Data was divided into cover of <10% (0) and >=10% (1). This binary dataset was set to fit a presence-absence model (GAM, mgcv for R). This model used predictor variables including depth, sourced from biological records where available and completed with depth data from SwAM's Symphony depth dataset (source: Swedish Maritime Administration) where missing; Wave exposure: log(n+1)-transformed; bottom salinity (source: Emodnet Chemistry); benthic substrate from SwAM's\nSymphony geology data series: hardbotten_250m for the\neast coast and block_250m for the west coast (source:\nGeological Survey of Sweden). On the west coast a slope\nlayer calculated from the depth grid was also included in the\nmodel. The model was predicted using the same layers in\n250 m resolution. The cut-off in probability was set to 0.30\nfor the east coast and 0.10 for the west coast (the cut-off\nvalues are derived from the model and set to maximise the\nnumber of correctly classified presences and absences), so\nthat the cut-off value or higher is considered a presence and\nlower is considered an absence.\nThe second input layer showing sites with observations of\n'Bivalves' was created from ”Miljöövervakning av Knähaken\nmarina reservat 2011, Stina Bertilsson Vuksan och Peter\nGöransson, Miljöförvaltningen i Helsingborgs stad” and\nSHARKdata where the point data is represented as \"P\"\n(Presence). It includes all bivalves from the above sources\nsuch as Macoma balthica, Cerastoderma glaucum, Arctica\nislandica, Modiolus modiolus etc. Various tools and internal\ndeveloped models were used in ArcMap 10.3 to produce the\nfinal data such as Dissolve, Point to Raster, Polygon to\nRaster, Raster calculator and Water Ways model 1.02\n(Aquabiota AB's internally developed model).\nMore detailed information on the lineage and methodology\nis available and can be supplied on request to the data\nowner.",

      "improvement_justification": "The layer explicitly states limitations in the resolution and quality of environmental predictor variables, particularly salinity and temperature data on the west coast, and weak coverage of sampling data in some parts. The recommendations call for 'more accurate depth, salinity and temperature data' and 'more survey effort'. These are fundamental data gaps that significantly impact the predictive model's accuracy and require substantial new data collection and potentially a re-evaluation of the model itself, indicating a 'large' improvement potential.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Addressing the identified limitations requires significant new data collection ('more survey effort' for depth, salinity, temperature, and sampling data), which is resource-intensive and complex. Improving the accuracy and resolution of environmental predictor variables, especially for parameters like salinity and temperature, often involves deploying new sensors, conducting extensive surveys, or integrating advanced oceanographic models. This level of data acquisition and integration, coupled with potential model re-calibration, points to 'high' difficulty.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can significantly help. While direct measurement of bottom salinity and temperature is challenging, satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) can provide valuable input for oceanographic models that predict bottom conditions. Satellite altimetry can contribute to more accurate depth models (e.g., Satellite-Derived Bathymetry in shallow, clear waters). Furthermore, satellite imagery (e.g., high-resolution optical data) can assist in mapping benthic substrate types in shallow areas, which is a key predictor variable. Although not a direct replacement for in-situ biological sampling, satellite data can provide broad-scale environmental context and potentially identify areas with suitable conditions for mussel reefs, guiding future survey efforts.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden, primarily offering Sentinel-2 data and national land cover, has limited direct applicability for improving this specific marine layer. Sentinel-2 is optical and has limited penetration in water, making it unsuitable for deep-water bathymetry, bottom salinity, or temperature. While it could potentially contribute to mapping very shallow water substrate types or coastal land use that might indirectly influence coastal habitats, the core limitations of the mussel reef layer (bottom salinity, temperature, and comprehensive biological sampling) are beyond the capabilities of DigitalEarthSweden's current offerings. Its focus is more on terrestrial and very shallow coastal applications, not the deeper marine environment where these mussels reside."

      "improvement_justification": "The layer explicitly states 'Limitations: None - data is high quality. It is the latest satellite data and is processed using state of the art algorithms and delivered via international open data archives.' and 'Recommendations: No current recommendations'. The only potential for improvement, given the 'small' criteria, is to update the temporal coverage (2014-2016) with more recent data from the same high-quality sources, which is a minor update.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Updating the temporal coverage with newer data from the same established sources (Copernicus Marine) is a straightforward process, requiring minimal technical expertise and coordination, fitting the 'low' difficulty criteria for 'updating temporal coverage with newer data from the same sources'.",
      "satellite_justification": "The layer is already based on 'modelled chlorophyll-a concentration data from satellite image analysis' (Copernicus Marine). Satellite remote sensing is fundamental to generating and improving this layer, as it provides the core chlorophyll-a data. Continued use of satellite data, specifically ocean color sensors, is essential for temporal updates and potential future refinements.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden primarily provides Sentinel-2 data and national land cover. While Sentinel-2 can provide some water quality parameters in coastal areas, the primary data source for this pelagic plankton layer is Copernicus Marine's modelled chlorophyll-a, which comes from dedicated ocean color sensors (e.g., MODIS, VIIRS, OLCI) that are not part of DigitalEarthSweden's core offerings. DigitalEarthSweden's focus is more on terrestrial and shallow coastal applications, not open ocean pelagic parameters like integrated chlorophyll-a across the water column."

    "summary": "This data set intends to show the complexity of the Swedish coastal zone as an indication of ecological importance. The source data used is Lantmäteriet's terrain map shoreline dataset. A cell value zero is equivalent to a completely flat shoreline and a cell value of 100 is equivalent to a shoreline of >1500m length in that cell. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",
    "summary_swedish": "Detta rasterskikt avser att visa komplexiteten av den svenska kustzonen som en indikation för ekologisk betydelse. Källdata som använts är kustlinjerasterskikt från Lantmäteriets terrängkarta. Ett cellvärde av 0 motsvarar en helt platt kustlinje, och ett cellvärde av 100 motsvarar en kustlinje på >1500 m längd i den cellen. Denna data skapades som ett data input layer för ’Symphony’ verktyget utvecklat av enheten för havsplaneringen på Havs- och vattenmyndigheten (HaV). Symphony används av HaV för bedömning av den kumulativa miljöpåverkan av mänsklig aktivitet i svenska vatten och används vid havsplanering. Återanvändning av denna data för andra ändamål är endast lämpligt efter vägledning och rådgivning av datakällorna.",
    "lineage": "The source data for this product is the Swedish coastline sourced from Terrängkartan from the Swedish mapping, cadastral and land registration authority (Läntmateriet) The symphony grid (250m cell) was used to split the shoreline into individual segments for each cell (using ArcMap 10.3.1) The length of each segment in each cell was calculated (using\nArcMap 10.3.1 geometry)\nThe shapefile was then transfered into a symphony cell\nstandard raster with the shapelength as the value.\nNormalisation: The data was linear transformed from 0-\n1500 m shoreline length/cell to 0-1 scale (outlier values up to\n3000 meter existed).",

      "improvement_justification": "The layer explicitly states that 'Shoreline complexity is a simplistic measure of ecological value' and recommends 'Introduce additional predictive factors into a future model such as terrain morphology, coastal geology or exposure'. This requires a fundamental overhaul of the model's input factors beyond just shoreline complexity, moving towards a more comprehensive ecological assessment. This constitutes a major improvement in the conceptualization of ecological value.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements (terrain morphology, coastal geology, exposure) would involve integrating new, diverse datasets and potentially developing new methodologies to combine these factors into a more robust ecological value assessment. While not requiring entirely new data collection programs from scratch, it would involve significant data acquisition, processing, and model development, placing it in the medium difficulty range.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can significantly help improve this layer. While shoreline complexity itself is derived from existing maps, the recommended 'additional predictive factors' such as terrain morphology (e.g., using Digital Elevation Models derived from satellite data), coastal geology (inferred from spectral properties or geomorphological features visible from space), and exposure (e.g., wave exposure derived from satellite altimetry or wind data) can all be informed or generated by satellite observations. Coastal habitat mapping, which is implicitly linked to ecological value, can also be enhanced by satellite imagery.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden can contribute to improving this layer. Sentinel-2 data can be used for detailed coastal morphology analysis, identifying different types of coastal structures, and potentially inferring aspects of coastal geology through spectral analysis of exposed rock or sediment types. While it doesn't directly provide 'exposure' data, the high-resolution imagery can support the mapping of features that influence exposure. The national land cover data could also provide context for the terrestrial-marine interface, which is relevant for coastal ecological value."

While satellite-derived bathymetry can provide depth information in very shallow, clear waters, it is not suitable for mapping sediment types at these depths or in aphotic conditions.

These collectively point to a need for a substantial overhaul of the data collection, processing, and validation methodology, moving beyond simple updates to address systematic biases and improve the foundational data quality.

Benthic substrate classification typically relies on in-situ sampling (grab samples, cores) or acoustic methods (multibeam echosounder, side-scan sonar) which provide direct or indirect measurements of sediment type. Satellite data cannot penetrate the water column sufficiently to characterize sub-surface sediment properties or differentiate between fine sediment types like mud, silt, and clay. Therefore, satellite remote sensing cannot directly generate or significantly improve the core data for this layer.",

Equal proportionality is assumed between the recorded sediment fractions but this may be invalid. 2) It was assumed that at least 20 replicates would be required to define the proportional makeup of each sediment class (in each sea area / depth / mapscale) . However, a power analysis was not undertaken to ensure sufficient sample availability for each surface substrate class and there is a significant range in replicate numbers between classes. 3) Where insufficient sample replication occurred to enable classification by depth, sea area and map scale data were averaged across depth ranges and between sea areas so certain classes are more reliable than others. 4) Surface substrates which form a veneer cover a smaller area of the seabed and consequently for some classes insufficient replicates were available for analysis. In this event the underlying sediment class was used for reclassification instead. In some classes on larger scale maps this might cause veneered sediments to be depicted as mixed proportions of the underlying substrate & veneer sediment fractions.",

      "improvement_justification": "The limitations highlight fundamental issues with the source data's representativeness (presence/absence only, assumed proportionality, insufficient replicates, averaging across areas/depths, veneer issues) and the lack of power analysis. The recommendations suggest sensitivity analysis, validation with empirical data (particle size analysis), expert review, and gathering additional source data from surrounding countries. These collectively point to a need for a substantial overhaul of the data collection and modeling approach, moving beyond simple updates to address systematic biases and improve the foundational data quality and model reliability. This aligns with 'large' improvement potential, requiring fundamental methodological overhauls and potentially new data collection protocols.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommendations would be challenging. Validating with empirical particle size analysis data implies a need for new, high-quality in-situ data collection or access to extensive existing datasets not currently utilized. Undertaking a power analysis and addressing insufficient replication would require significant statistical expertise and potentially new sampling campaigns. Harmonizing data from surrounding countries is a complex task involving data standardization and cross-border collaboration. These efforts require significant resources, advanced technical expertise, and extensive coordination, fitting the 'high' difficulty criteria.",
      "satellite_justification": "This layer predicts the probability of soft marine benthic substrates (sand and gravel) in aphotic zones deeper than 60m. Satellite remote sensing, particularly optical sensors, has very limited penetration depth in water, typically only a few tens of meters in very clear waters, and cannot 'see' the seabed at 60m+ depths, especially in potentially turbid coastal waters. Acoustic methods (e.g., multibeam echosounders, side-scan sonar) or physical sampling (e.g., grab samples, cores) are the primary methods for mapping deep-water benthic substrates. Therefore, satellite data cannot directly generate or significantly improve this specific layer.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden primarily offers Sentinel-2 optical data and national land cover data. As explained for satellite remote sensing, optical data cannot penetrate to 60m+ depths to map benthic substrates. The land cover data is terrestrial/coastal and not relevant for deep marine benthic environments. Therefore, DigitalEarthSweden's current offerings cannot directly generate or improve this specific layer, which focuses on deep-water marine sediment types."

      "improvement_justification": "The layer has fundamental issues related to data availability (presence/absence only, insufficient replicates for certain classes), assumptions about proportionality, and reclassification methods. The recommendations suggest a sensitivity analysis, validation with empirical data (particle size analysis), expert review, and gathering additional source data from surrounding countries. These point to a need for a significant overhaul in data collection, methodology, and validation, indicating a 'large' improvement potential.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommendations would require significant effort. Validating with empirical data (particle size analysis) implies new data collection or access to extensive, high-quality in-situ data. Undertaking a power analysis to ensure sufficient sample availability, addressing the proportionality assumption, and potentially re-evaluating the reclassification logic are complex tasks. Gathering harmonized data from surrounding countries is also a substantial undertaking. These collectively suggest 'high' difficulty.",
      "satellite_justification": "This layer predicts the probability of soft marine benthic substrates (sand and gravel) in the photic zone. Satellite remote sensing, while useful for broad-scale habitat mapping in very shallow, clear waters, cannot directly measure or reliably infer sediment type (sand/gravel vs. mud/silt) on the seabed, especially at depths within the photic zone where water column effects are significant. It also cannot provide the detailed particle size analysis needed for validation. In-situ sampling (e.g., grab samples, cores) is required for ground-truthing sediment composition.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden primarily offers Sentinel-2 optical imagery and national land cover data. While Sentinel-2 can be used for some shallow water applications (e.g., bathymetry in very clear waters, broad habitat types if distinct spectral signatures exist), it cannot directly identify or quantify benthic sediment types like sand and gravel, especially not at the resolution and accuracy required to address the limitations of this layer. The national land cover data is terrestrial-focused and not relevant for marine benthic substrates. Therefore, DigitalEarthSweden data cannot directly generate or significantly improve this specific marine benthic substrate layer."

      "improvement_justification": "Although 'No limitations identified' and 'No recommendations suggested' are stated by SLU, the layer's lineage describes a modeling approach (interpolation, compensation for migration/land-water ratio, normalization) based on inventory point data from 2010-2015. The 'Maintenance: Not Planned' status and the age of the data (2010-2015) suggest a 'medium' improvement potential. Updating the temporal period with more recent inventory data would be a moderate improvement. Furthermore, the modeling approach could potentially be refined or validated with more recent or comprehensive in-situ data, or by incorporating environmental covariates if available, moving beyond simple interpolation and compensation. The 're-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources' also hints at potential limitations in its broader applicability without further refinement or validation.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Updating the temporal coverage would require acquiring new inventory data from the Swedish Museum of Natural History, which implies coordination and data transfer. If the modeling approach itself were to be refined (e.g., incorporating environmental covariates or more sophisticated spatial modeling techniques), this would require moderate technical expertise and potentially new data sources, placing it in the 'medium' difficulty category. The current methodology involves a 60km search window and compensation for migration, which suggests a degree of complexity that would make any significant methodological refinement a 'medium' difficulty task.",
      "satellite_justification": "Grey seal distribution is primarily determined by factors such as prey availability, breeding sites (haul-out sites on land or ice), and migration patterns. Satellite remote sensing, while excellent for environmental parameters like SST, chlorophyll, or land cover, cannot directly detect or monitor seal populations or their abundance with the resolution and specificity required for this layer. While satellite imagery could potentially identify suitable haul-out sites (e.g., specific islands or ice floes), it cannot quantify seal abundance or their predicted distribution across marine waters, especially considering their underwater foraging and migratory behaviors. This layer is based on inventory data, likely from aerial surveys or direct observations, which are not satellite-derived.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden primarily offers Sentinel-2 optical data and national land cover data. These datasets are not suitable for directly monitoring or modeling marine mammal distribution in open waters. While Sentinel-2 could potentially identify coastal features or land cover types that might serve as haul-out sites, it cannot provide information on seal abundance in the marine environment, nor can it track their movements or foraging patterns. The layer's underlying data are inventory point data from national monitoring, which are in-situ observations, not satellite-derived. Therefore, DigitalEarthSweden's current offerings cannot directly generate or significantly improve this specific marine mammal distribution layer."

      "improvement_justification": "Despite 'No limitations identified' and 'No recommendations suggested' by SLU, the layer's underlying data are from 2010-2015, making it temporally outdated for current marine planning. The methodology uses a fixed 40km search window for interpolation, which might not fully capture the dynamic nature of seal distribution or account for varying habitat use. The 'compensate the distribution to account for the ratio of land/water within the home range' step is a good start but could be refined with more sophisticated habitat modeling. The 'Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources' suggests a lack of robustness for broader application without expert consultation, indicating potential for methodological improvements to increase its general applicability. Updating the temporal coverage and potentially refining the interpolation/modeling approach would be a moderate improvement.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Updating the temporal coverage would require accessing newer national monitoring data (if available) and re-running the existing processing steps, which is a medium difficulty task due to data acquisition and processing. Refining the interpolation or modeling to account for more dynamic factors or better habitat representation would require methodological development and validation, also a medium difficulty task. It's not a simple data refresh but involves re-processing and potential methodological adjustments.",
      "satellite_justification": "Harbour seal distribution is primarily determined by factors like prey availability, haul-out sites, and human disturbance, which are not directly observable or quantifiable by current satellite remote sensing capabilities. While satellites can provide data on sea surface temperature or chlorophyll-a (indirectly related to prey), they cannot directly monitor seal abundance or fine-scale distribution. Haul-out sites are typically coastal features, but direct seal counting from space is not feasible at the resolution and frequency required. Therefore, satellite remote sensing cannot directly generate or significantly improve this specific layer, which relies on inventory data and predictive modeling based on those inventories.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden primarily offers Sentinel-2 optical data and national land cover data. These are useful for mapping coastal land use, habitat types (e.g., wetlands, rocky shores), and changes in coastal infrastructure. While haul-out sites for seals are coastal, DigitalEarthSweden's data cannot directly detect or count seals, nor can it provide the marine environmental data (e.g., prey distribution, underwater acoustics) that would be crucial for modeling seal abundance. The layer is about marine distribution and abundance, which is beyond the scope of DigitalEarthSweden's current offerings. Therefore, DigitalEarthSweden data cannot directly generate or significantly improve this layer."

Equal proportionality is assumed between the recorded sediment fractions but this may be invalid. 2) It was assumed that at least 20 replicates would be required to define the proportional makeup of each sediment class (in each sea area / depth / mapscale) . However, a power analysis was not undertaken to ensure sufficient sample availability for each surface substrate class and there is a significant range in replicate numbers between classes. 3) Where insufficient sample replication occured to enable classification by depth, sea area and map scale data were averaged across depth ranges and between sea areas so certain classes are more reliable than others. 4) Surface substrates which form a veneer cover a smaller area of the seabed and consequently for some classes insufficient replicates were available for analysis. In this event the underlying sediment class was used for reclassification instead. In some classes on larger scale maps this might cause veneered sediments to be depicted as mixed proportions of the underlying substrate & veneer sediment fractions.",

      "improvement_justification": "The limitations highlight fundamental issues with the underlying data (presence/absence, assumed proportionality, insufficient replication, use of underlying sediment class for veneers) and the methodology (no power analysis). The recommendations suggest a sensitivity analysis, validation with empirical data (particle size analysis), expert review, and gathering additional source data. These point to a need for substantial new data collection (e.g., particle size analysis for validation), fundamental methodological overhauls (revisiting proportionality assumptions, ensuring sufficient replication), and potentially a complete re-conceptualization of how substrate classes are defined and mapped, moving beyond simple presence/absence. This goes beyond minor updates or simple integration of existing data.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements, particularly validating proportionality with empirical data like particle size analysis, undertaking a power analysis for replication, and potentially re-classifying surface substrates, would require significant resources for new data collection (e.g., extensive field sampling for particle size analysis), advanced technical expertise for statistical analysis (power analysis, spatial modeling), and extensive coordination to harmonize data from surrounding countries. Addressing the 'veneer' issue might also require more sophisticated spatial modeling. This is not a simple update but a major re-evaluation and potential re-engineering of the underlying data and model.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing, specifically Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) from optical sensors, could potentially help improve the depth data component, especially in shallow, clear waters, which is relevant for the photic zone. While SDB cannot directly identify hard bottom substrates, it can provide more detailed and up-to-date bathymetry, which is a key input. Additionally, high-resolution optical imagery (e.g., from Sentinel-2 or commercial satellites) could potentially be used in very shallow, clear waters to infer substrate types or identify areas of high rugosity indicative of hard bottoms, though direct classification of 'rocks, boulders, and bedrock' from space is challenging and often requires ground truthing. It could also aid in mapping coastal geomorphology that might correlate with hard bottom presence. Therefore, satellite data can enhance or validate input layers, even if not directly generating the hard bottom probability.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden, through its Sentinel-2 Level-2A data products, offers high-resolution optical imagery (10-60m) that could contribute to improving this layer. Specifically, Sentinel-2 data can be used for: 1) Enhancing or validating the depth model in shallow, clear coastal waters through Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) techniques. 2) Potentially identifying areas of high rugosity or distinct spectral signatures in very shallow, clear waters that might correlate with hard bottom presence, though direct classification of specific substrate types (rocks, boulders) is challenging and requires extensive ground truthing. 3) Monitoring coastal changes that might influence substrate distribution. While DigitalEarthSweden does not provide direct substrate data, its optical imagery can improve or validate key input layers (depth) and potentially offer indirect insights into substrate characteristics in shallow areas, especially in conjunction with the national land cover data for coastal context."

    "lineage": "These data were prepared primarily from acoustic monitoring data collected during the SAMBAH project between 2011 and 2013. The probability of encountering porpoises was calculated from measurements of sounds emitted from the animals. The study included animals in the Baltic Sea between Åland and the Belt Sea (see method description in Static Acoustic Monitoring of the Baltic Harbor porpoise, SAMBAH, non-technical report http://www.sambah.org/Non-technical-report-v.-1.8.1.pdf). Summer and winter data were provided and these were combined (mean average) to produce an annual dataset for Symphony. The SAMBAH project (See SAMBAH Non- technical report) suggests a limit of the Baltic porpoise population. At this suggested demarcation line was therefore used to isolate the Baltic Population for separate treatment in Symphony. Data were extrapolated using an inverse distance weighting algorithmn to avoid a sharp break. Values were normalized between 0 - 100 using a linear transformation (where 100 represents the maximum value in the data). The were then resampled to a 250mx250m grid. More detailed information on the lineage and methodology is available and can be supplied on request to the data owner.",

      "improvement_justification": "The primary limitation explicitly states a 'fictitious decline' in porpoise population due to interpolation, which 'does not correspond to real conditions'. This indicates a fundamental methodological flaw in representing the actual distribution, requiring a significant overhaul of the spatial modeling approach rather than just minor updates. Additionally, the data is from 2011-2013, making it temporally outdated for current policy formulation.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Addressing the 'fictitious decline' requires re-evaluating and potentially re-modeling the spatial distribution of porpoises, especially at the population boundary. This would likely involve advanced spatial statistics or ecological modeling techniques beyond simple interpolation, potentially requiring new data integration or a re-analysis of the original acoustic data with a different spatial approach. Updating the temporal period would also require new acoustic monitoring data, which is resource-intensive.",
      "satellite_justification": "The layer is based on acoustic monitoring data of porpoises, which are marine mammals. Satellite remote sensing cannot directly detect porpoises or their acoustic signals. While satellites can provide environmental parameters (e.g., SST, chlorophyll) that might correlate with porpoise distribution, they cannot generate or directly improve the core porpoise density data itself, which relies on in-situ acoustic measurements.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden primarily offers Sentinel-2 optical data and national land cover data. These datasets are focused on terrestrial and shallow coastal environments and are not suitable for monitoring marine mammal populations in offshore waters or for processing acoustic data. The capabilities of DigitalEarthSweden do not align with the data type or the specific challenges of this porpoise distribution layer."

Such a study was published in 2011 containing the data from 64 porpoises tagged from 1997 – 2007 (Sveegaard et al. 2011). From 2007 to 2016, Aarhus University have tagged an additional 56 individuals i.e. 120 harbour porpoises in total. Data from 18 individuals were removed prior to further\nanalysis by Aarhus due to data quality issues.\nThe data from 78 animals (located in the Belt Sea area) were\nanalysed by Aarhus univeristity using kernel density\nestimation (KDE) generating summer, winter and annual\ndatasets. A detail description of the KDE method can be\nfound in Sveegaard et al 2011 data were filtered using a DAR\nfilter (Distance, Angle, Rate, Douglas Argos filter v7.03) to 1\nlocation per porpoise per day. KDE were performed using\nthe ArcToolbox in ArcGIS v. 10.3. Grid size = 1x1 km,\nsmoothing factor = 20.000 and each animal were weighted\nequally in the analysis.\nIn preparation for use in Symphony only the annual data\nwere used and these data were logarithmically transformed\nand normalised. The data were transformed using a (Log10\n(cell value + 1) calculation in ArcGIS. Values were then\nnormalized (linear rescale in ArcGIS) between 0 - 100 with\n100 representing the maximum value within the Swedish\nEEZ.\nThe were then resampled to the 250mx250m Symphony\ngrid.\nMore detailed information on the lineage and methodology\nis available and can be supplied on request to the data\nowner.\nMethod reference:\nSveegaard, S., Teilmann, J., Tougaard, J., Dietz, R.,\nMouritsen, K.N., Desportes, G., Siebert, U., 2011.

    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "These data are based on porpoises which were caught in Danish waters, this may lead to sampling bias (when intending to represent populations in Swedish waters). The porpoise population data were log transformed before being used in Symphony – this ‘smooths’ the data providing a more general data trend. It is intended to ensure the data is conservatively interpreted. Smoothing the data does however decrease the spatial specificity and the relative importance of specific spatial ‘hotspots’ which could be linked for example to seabed features.",
    "recommendations_for_data_improvement": "The effect of pressures on the different populations (i.e. Belt-sea, Baltic and North Sea population) should be evaluated separately as sensitivity may vary due to the large difference in total population size. Collection of additional data from animals in Swedish waters would enhance data quality. Further work to test for spatial relationships between the porpoise population and predictor\nvariables (e.g. seabed/water column features) might provide additional insight relevant to\nspatial planning.",

      "improvement_justification": "The layer has significant limitations, including sampling bias due to porpoises being caught in Danish waters for a layer intended to represent Swedish waters, and the log transformation 'smoothing' the data, which decreases spatial specificity and the importance of hotspots. The recommendations explicitly call for collecting additional data from animals in Swedish waters and evaluating the effect of pressures on different porpoise populations separately, which implies a need for more nuanced and spatially specific data. These are fundamental issues requiring new data collection and potentially a re-evaluation of the modeling approach to capture spatial hotspots, indicating a 'large' improvement potential.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements, particularly collecting additional data from animals in Swedish waters, is a 'high' difficulty task. It involves significant resources for animal tagging, tracking, and data processing. Furthermore, testing for spatial relationships with predictor variables (e.g., seabed/water column features) and potentially re-evaluating the smoothing approach would require advanced analytical expertise and potentially new modeling techniques. Addressing sampling bias fundamentally requires new data collection, which is resource-intensive.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing cannot directly generate or significantly improve this layer. The layer is based on tracking individual porpoises using satellite tags, which is a form of in-situ biological sampling and telemetry, not remote sensing of environmental parameters. While satellite remote sensing can provide environmental context (e.g., SST, chlorophyll), it cannot directly measure porpoise distribution or population density. The core data for this layer comes from animal tracking, which is distinct from satellite remote sensing of the marine environment.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden's primary offerings (Sentinel-2 Level-2A data and national land cover data) are not directly applicable to generating or improving this porpoise distribution layer. These datasets are focused on optical imagery for land and shallow coastal waters, land cover, and coastal development. They do not provide information on marine mammal distribution, population density, or the specific environmental parameters (e.g., deep-water features, prey distribution) that might influence porpoise movements. The data required for improvement (animal tracking in Swedish waters) is outside the scope of DigitalEarthSweden's current offerings."

Underlying data are modelled population density data generated from tracking of 78 satellite-tagged porpoises during two periods between 1997 and 2016 by Aarhus University. These modelled data were then normalized and log transformed for use in Symphony. A cell value of 0 shows areas where no porpoises are predicted and a cell value of 100 is equivalent to the maximum average annual population density (within the Swedish EEZ). These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",

      "improvement_justification": "While no limitations or recommendations were explicitly identified by SLU, the temporal period (2010-2015) is outdated for a layer intended for current marine spatial planning. Updating this layer with more recent inventory data would be a moderate improvement. Additionally, the interpolation method (60km search window) and normalization to Symphony requirements could potentially be refined or validated with more recent data or advanced modeling techniques, moving beyond simple updates.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Updating the layer with newer inventory data from SHARK would require data acquisition, processing, and re-running the existing modeling steps (interpolation, land/water compensation, normalization). This is a moderate effort, requiring coordination with data providers and technical expertise in data processing and GIS. If methodological refinements were also pursued (e.g., exploring alternative interpolation methods or incorporating environmental covariates), the difficulty would lean towards medium.",
      "satellite_justification": "Ringed seals are marine mammals that are typically observed at the surface or in ice-covered areas. While satellites can monitor sea ice extent and concentration, directly detecting or monitoring ringed seal abundance or distribution from satellite imagery is not feasible. Their small size, subsurface behavior, and the resolution/spectral capabilities of current operational satellites make direct detection impossible. The layer is based on inventory point data, which are collected through in-situ surveys (e.g., aerial surveys, ice surveys).",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden primarily provides Sentinel-2 optical data and national land cover data. These datasets are not suitable for directly monitoring marine mammal populations like ringed seals. Sentinel-2's capabilities are focused on land and shallow, clear coastal waters, and it lacks the resolution or specialized sensors needed for marine mammal detection or for providing environmental parameters directly relevant to seal distribution in deeper or ice-covered waters. The land cover data is terrestrial and not directly applicable to marine species distribution modeling."

      "improvement_justification": "The layer's primary limitation is its low spatial resolution (50km grid) and the lack of local hydrological and biophysical conditions, leading to significant model uncertainty. The recommendation explicitly points to the need for 'climate model downscaling' and the inclusion of 'ocean acidification as a parameter in regional models'. This requires a fundamental methodological overhaul, integrating global models with regional climate models (like SMHI's RCO) and developing new regional ocean acidification models, which constitutes a 'large' improvement potential.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements, specifically downscaling global ocean acidification models and integrating them with regional climate models (like SMHI's RCO) to account for local conditions, is a complex task. It would require significant computational resources, advanced modeling expertise, and extensive coordination between different modeling groups (e.g., NOAA, SMHI). This falls under 'high' difficulty as it involves developing new methodologies for a parameter not currently included in regional models.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing cannot directly measure ocean pH or acidity. While satellites can provide data on sea surface temperature, salinity (to some extent), and other parameters that influence ocean chemistry, they do not directly measure the concentration of dissolved CO2 or pH. The core issue here is a chemical parameter that requires in-situ measurements or complex biogeochemical models, not direct satellite observation.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden primarily offers Sentinel-2 optical data and national land cover data. These datasets are valuable for terrestrial and shallow coastal mapping (e.g., land use, vegetation, coastal development) but do not provide direct measurements or proxies for ocean acidification. The limitations of the layer are related to ocean chemistry modeling at a regional scale, which is outside the scope of DigitalEarthSweden's current offerings."

The source data for this product are from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) and are based on their RCO -SCOBI emission scenario A2 ( which is predicts comparatively high greenhouse gas emissions). A cell value of zero is equivalent to no sea surface temperature increase by the year 2050 and a cell value of 100 equates to a temperature increase of 2 degrees Celsius by 2050 (the highest increase predicted in the Symphony study area. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",

      "improvement_justification": "The layer has fundamental methodological issues and data gaps. The 'Limitations' explicitly state that the product assumes habitat change due to development equates to loss and does not consider habitat creation, which is a significant conceptual flaw. The 'Recommendations' suggest justifying the weighting (implying a need for evidence-based impact scoring rather than 'agreed upon values'), updating with latest data, and potentially extracting development types for an artificial reef dataset. Addressing the assumption of 'loss only' and providing evidence-based weighting would require a fundamental re-evaluation of the impact model, moving beyond simple presence data and 'agreed upon' weights to a more nuanced understanding of ecological impact. Updating data and potentially extracting new datasets also points to a need for substantial data integration and processing.",
      "difficulty_justification": "While updating data (from METRIA) might be straightforward, justifying the weighting with evidence and potentially re-conceptualizing the 'impact' to account for habitat creation would require significant research, ecological modeling expertise, and potentially new data collection or analysis. This moves beyond simple data updates to a more complex methodological overhaul. Integrating new data sources and potentially creating new datasets (e.g., for artificial reefs) also adds to the complexity, requiring moderate technical expertise and coordination.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can significantly help improve this layer. High-resolution optical satellite imagery (e.g., from Sentinel-2, or commercial providers) can be used to: 1) Update and verify the presence of houses, buildings, harbours, marinas, jetties/docks/piers, and other coastal infrastructure more frequently and systematically than relying on disparate shapefiles from different years. 2) Monitor coastal land use change and development over time, providing more current data than 2010-2013. 3) Potentially identify areas of habitat change (both loss and creation) by observing changes in coastal morphology, vegetation, and water quality indicators, although direct 'habitat creation' assessment would be challenging without ground truth. 4) Provide a consistent and repeatable method for mapping coastal exploitation indicators.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden, specifically through its Sentinel-2 Level-2A data products and national land cover data, can directly contribute to generating and improving this layer. Sentinel-2 imagery can be used for: 1) Updating the spatial extent and presence of coastal infrastructure (houses, buildings, harbours, marinas, jetties/docks/piers) more frequently and consistently. 2) Monitoring coastal land use and land cover changes associated with exploitation. 3) The national land cover data can provide a baseline for identifying developed areas and changes over time. This allows for more current and consistent data input for the 'exploitation' layer, addressing the temporal limitation and potentially providing a more robust basis for identifying developed areas than the current disparate shapefiles."

The second dataset used was dominant sediment type derived from Helcom's 2006 Balance project. Each point location record was allocated the bottom substrate type derived from the sediment dataset using a spatial join and then each site was buffered by 200m. A comparison of the sediment type at each site and the nearest port was undertaken and differences between sediment types were used to guide a spatial selection of sites which are\nlikely to result in habitat loss.\nThese vector data were then translated to a binary raster file\nmatching the Symphony grid specification.",

      "improvement_justification": "The layer has significant limitations, including outdated benthic substrate data (2006 vs. updated SGU data), lack of specific information on source, type, and volume of dumped sediment, and a simplified binary risk assessment. The recommendation explicitly states that 'it was not possible to model the relative impact at different sites' due to data gaps, suggesting a need for a more nuanced and quantitative impact assessment. Approximating sediment type through surrounding areas is a major simplification. Addressing these issues would require integrating new, more detailed data (sediment quantities, types, and sources) and potentially a more sophisticated modeling approach beyond a simple binary classification, moving towards a 'large' improvement.",
      "difficulty_justification": "While the improvements are substantial, they don't necessarily require entirely new, unproven methodologies. The core challenge lies in data acquisition and integration, specifically obtaining better managed and more detailed dredge dumping site data (quantities, types, sources) and updating benthic substrate information. This would involve significant coordination with data providers (SwAM, SGU, HELCOM, EMODNET) and potentially developing a more complex spatial model for impact assessment, but it's within the realm of established data management and spatial analysis techniques. This falls under 'medium' difficulty, as it requires moderate technical expertise, coordination, and resource investment.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing is unlikely to directly help generate or significantly improve this layer. The layer focuses on habitat loss due to dredge spoil dumping, which requires detailed information on the dumped material (type, volume, source) and the benthic substrate. Satellites can provide information on water column turbidity or suspended sediments, which might indicate dumping events, but they cannot directly characterize the dumped material's properties or the long-term benthic habitat changes at the resolution and depth required. Benthic substrate mapping from satellites is generally limited to very shallow, clear waters, and the primary data gaps here are related to the specifics of the dumping operations and the underlying benthic habitat, which are best assessed through in-situ sampling or detailed bathymetric surveys.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden, primarily offering Sentinel-2 optical data and national land cover, is not suitable for improving this layer. The layer's core data needs are related to sub-surface benthic habitats, specific dredge spoil characteristics (grain size, volume), and precise locations of dumping sites, none of which can be directly derived or significantly enhanced by Sentinel-2 imagery or terrestrial land cover data. Sentinel-2's capabilities are limited to shallow, clear waters for bathymetry or habitat mapping, and it cannot provide the detailed information on sediment properties or the impact of dumping on the seabed that this layer requires."

The source data includes coastal features (road and rail bridges, lighthouses) and the nordstream pipeline. The data were derived primarily from Lantmateriets open data (terrain map and road map). A cell value of zero is equivalent to no habitat loss and a cell value of 100 is equivalent to a complete replacement of habitat. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",

Källdata inkluderar kustområden (väg- och järnvägsbroar, fyrar) och Nord Streams rörledning. Data kommer huvudsakligen från Lantmäteriets öppna data (Terrängkartan och Vägkartan). Ett cellvärde av 0 motsvarar ingen habitatförlust, och ett cellvärde av 100 motsvarar fullständig habitatförändring. Denna data skapades som ett data input layer för ’Symphony’ verktyget utvecklat av enheten för havsplaneringen på Havs- och vattenmyndigheten (HaV). Symphony används av HaV för bedömning av den kumulativa miljöpåverkan av mänsklig aktivitet i svenska vatten och används vid havsplanering.

Clip roads in the sea, remove roads that are on land and create polygon with buffer (25m), manual position corrections with aerial photography. Clip railways in the sea, remove railways on land and create polygon with buffer (25m), manual position corrections with aerial photography.

High-resolution optical satellite imagery (e.g., from commercial providers or even Sentinel-2 in clear coastal waters) can assist in identifying and mapping coastal infrastructure like docks, piers, and potentially even larger buoys or offshore wind turbine foundations, especially in shallow, clear waters. While not directly providing 'habitat loss' values, it can help in the accurate spatial delineation and verification of the physical infrastructure that causes the loss. Satellite-derived bathymetry could also indirectly inform the context of these structures in shallow areas.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden, specifically through its Sentinel-2 Level-2A data products and national land cover data, can help improve this layer. Sentinel-2 imagery can be used to identify and map coastal infrastructure such as docks, piers, and potentially the footprints of larger lighthouses or bridges, especially where they extend into the water. The national land cover data could provide a baseline for coastal land use and help in distinguishing land-based infrastructure from marine infrastructure. While it won't directly identify all offshore features like buoys or pipelines, it can significantly aid in the mapping and verification of near-shore and coastal structures, addressing some of the identified limitations."

      "improvement_justification": "The layer's limitations highlight fundamental issues with its current methodology, specifically the simplistic 1000m buffer and the exclusion of upstream effluent releases. The recommendations suggest a complete overhaul of the risk assessment, moving from a binary high/no impact to a spatially graduated reduction, incorporating upstream influences, gathering empirical validation data, and integrating attribute information like discharge volumes and environmental criteria (currents/sediments). This requires a fundamental re-conceptualization of the risk model, moving beyond simple spatial proximity to a more complex, data-driven predictive approach, which constitutes a 'large' improvement.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements would be 'high' difficulty. It requires developing a new, spatially graduated risk model (rather than a simple buffer), integrating diverse new data sources (empirical monitoring data from VISS/SGU, attribute information on discharge volumes, environmental criteria like currents/sediments, emergency discharge frequency), and potentially modeling upstream influences. This involves significant data integration challenges, advanced spatial modeling techniques, and extensive coordination with multiple data providers (SEPA, County Admin, SGU, NSVA). It moves beyond simple data updates to a complex, multi-variate modeling approach.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can significantly help improve this layer. While direct 'synthetic toxin' detection is not feasible, satellite data can provide crucial environmental criteria for a more nuanced risk model. For example, ocean color sensors can provide data on water quality parameters like turbidity and suspended sediments, which are relevant to pollutant dispersion and accumulation. Sea surface temperature and altimetry can inform current patterns, which are critical for modeling pollutant transport. Coastal land use and development, detectable by high-resolution optical satellites, can indicate areas of higher human activity and potential pollution sources. Satellite-derived bathymetry could refine understanding of shallow water environments influencing pollutant pathways. While not directly measuring toxins, these parameters are essential inputs for a more sophisticated spatial risk model.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden can contribute to improving this layer, primarily through its Sentinel-2 Level-2A data and national land cover data. Sentinel-2 can be used to map coastal land use and infrastructure, identify impervious surfaces, and monitor changes in coastal development, which are indirect indicators of potential pollution sources or pathways. While its water penetration is limited to clear, shallow waters, it can still provide insights into coastal morphology and land-sea interface characteristics. The national land cover data can provide detailed information on land use around wastewater treatment plants, which could be used to infer potential upstream influences or the nature of the surrounding environment. However, DigitalEarthSweden's capabilities are primarily terrestrial/coastal and optical, meaning it cannot directly provide oceanographic parameters like currents or detailed water quality chemistry, which would still require other satellite or in-situ sources."

SEL from an explosion with a force equivalent to 263 kg TNT was then modelled from the Swedish Armed Forces’ detonation practice areas. As information on the localisation of individual detonations was not available it was assumed that a detonation could occur at least once per year anywhere within the detonation practice areas. Values above the highest value (i.e. 216 dB re 1 uPa SEL) measured by Benda- Beckman et al., 2015 were used as the maximum value in the raster (i.e. cell value of 100). The resulting raster was linearly normalised with the minimum value (i.e. cell value 0) representing the threshold where injuries to porpoises are first observed (TTS of 164 dB re 1 uPa SEL) (Benda-Beckman et al., 2015). Results were time integrated using reports of historical (2015) number of explosions in permitted areas and assuming a weekly recovery time (thus 52 explosions per year genereates maximum score). There is insufficient information available from the Swedish\nArmed Forces to assess whether the scale of the detonations\nis reasonable with respect to the Armed Forces’ activities\nwithin respective detonation areas.

This leads to assumed impact levels and a lack of spatial resolution for predicted impacts. The recommendations call for gathering additional attribution on typical loading weights and positional data on specific detonation locations. This requires fundamental new data collection and a re-evaluation of the modeling approach, moving from an assumption of 'anywhere within the area' to specific points, which constitutes a major improvement.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements requires significant effort. Gathering detailed attribution on loading weights and precise positional data for military detonations involves extensive coordination with the Armed Forces, who currently do not provide this level of detail (as evidenced by the 'insufficient information' and 'discussion on the method did not occur' statements). This is a data acquisition challenge requiring high-level collaboration and potentially new data collection protocols, making it a high difficulty task.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing cannot directly generate or improve this layer. The layer models sound exposure levels from underwater explosions, which are acoustic phenomena. Satellites cannot detect underwater sound, nor can they directly observe the specific location, type, or frequency of underwater detonations or the resulting sound propagation. While satellites can monitor some surface activities, they cannot provide the core data needed (detonation specifics, sound levels) for this layer.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden's primary datasets (Sentinel-2 Level-2A and national land cover data) are not relevant for generating or improving this layer. Sentinel-2 is an optical sensor primarily for land and shallow water surface analysis, and cannot detect underwater acoustic events or provide information on military detonation practices. The national land cover data is also terrestrial/coastal and does not relate to underwater sound modeling or military activities in marine waters."

Processing was as follows: 1) Firing ranges were imported. 2) Coastal intersection points were calculated 3) Ranges split into 3 layers based on scale and shape - funnel shaped areas were assumed to be ranges that deploy artillery and were split into large - areas over 20,000m2, medium - between 20 and10,000km2 and small - under 5000km2. It was assumed that larger artillery are used in larger firing ranges. 3) Concentric ring buffers were generated from the centroid of the coastal intersection points. 4) Allocate a stepwise score with distance for large ranges 10 - 5km, 30 - 10km, 30 - 15km, 80 - 20km, 60 - 25km, 50 - 30km, 40 - 35km, 30 - 40km, 20 - 45km, 10 > 50km 5) Allocate a stepwise score with distance for medium ranges 10 - 2km, 30 - 4km, 30 - 6km, 80 - 8km, 60 - 10km, 50 - 12km, 40 - 14km, 30 - 16km, 20 - 18km, 10 > 20km 6) Allocate a stepwise score with distance for small ranges 10 - 0.5km, 30 - 1km, 30 - 1.5km, 80 - 2km, 60 - 2.5km, 50 - 3km, 40 - 3.5km, 30 - 4km, 20 - 4.5km, 10 > 5km Note - the spread of fire was assumed to be in an arc with the\ndominant area of impact fairly close but diminishing with\ndistance.\n7) All remaining areas (non funnel shaped) were assumed to\nbe areas with only small arms fire and therefore were\nallocated an impact score of 10\n8) All data layers were combined into a single raster layer\n9) A spatial filter was applied to blur the data (focal\nstatistics, 5km mean)\n10) Data were rescaled on a 0-100 scale and clipped to the\nSymphony Grid.",

The recommendations explicitly call for a 'more reliable model with empirical validation' and suggest obtaining detailed data from the Swedish Armed Forces (type of firing range, operational history, munitions used, metal content, firing patterns). This indicates a need for a fundamental overhaul of the model and data inputs, moving beyond simple updates or minor methodological refinements.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements would require significant effort. Obtaining sensitive data from the Swedish Armed Forces, which is explicitly mentioned as potentially sensitive, would involve extensive coordination. Developing a 'more reliable model with empirical validation' would likely require advanced modeling techniques and potentially new data collection (e.g., sediment sampling for validation), which is a high resource and expertise undertaking. The current model is based on assumptions, so moving to an empirically validated model is a major shift.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing cannot directly measure inorganic toxin contamination in marine sediments or the historical use of firing ranges and munitions. While satellites can monitor some aspects of marine environments (e.g., water quality, bathymetry in shallow areas), they do not provide direct measurements of heavy metal concentrations in sediments, which is the core subject of this layer. The data needed for improvement (munitions, firing patterns, actual sediment contamination) are not observable from space.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden, primarily offering Sentinel-2 data and national land cover, is not suitable for generating or improving this layer. Sentinel-2 is an optical sensor and cannot detect heavy metal contamination in marine sediments. Its capabilities are focused on land and very shallow, clear coastal waters for features like land cover, vegetation, and coastal development. The core data required for improving this layer (details on military activities, types of munitions, and direct sediment contamination measurements) are outside the scope of DigitalEarthSweden's offerings."

    "lineage": "Data were from the Swedish National Grid (SVK) and included a shape file of offshore wind farms. Data processing was as follows: The distance from the nearest wind power turbines was calculated using a buffer with a fixed distance (500, 1000, 1500, 2250 and 3000 m). The values were aggregated where “the highest value wins”. There is no general rule that dictates distance for avoidance of wind power turbines by seabirds but is instead species and location specific. The lower limit of 3000 m is a theoretical impact distance for avoidance behaviour by seabirds that has been mentioned in environmental impact assessments (Ramböll, 2015). However, the literature does not demonstrate that a known avoidance occurs down to this distance (e.g. the so called synthesis report from Vindval, Green et al., 2011 specifies, as a rule, avoidance at less than 500 m and typically at approx. 100-200 m, with the exception of loons where reduced density has been demonstrated down to approx. 2km). Normalisation was linear\nwith respect to the areal impact, where areas outside of the\ntheoretical impact areas (i.e. > 3000 m) were assigned a cell value\nof 0 and areas within 500 m of wind power turbines were assigned\na cell value of 100. Discussion of the method occurred between\nWSP (consultant) and SWaM (client).\nMore detailed information on the lineage and methodology is\navailable and can be supplied on request to the data owner.",

It may also be important to note that avoidance studies often fail to describe the spatial scale of avoidance and they affected by weather and other behavioural factors. The height of the wind turbines are not included in this model. Mitigation of windfarm construction includes building higher turbines which can theoretically reduce the risk of collision (for some species) - see https://www.bto.org/sites/default/files/u28/downloads/Projects/Final_Report_SOSS02 _BTOReview.pdf.",

      "improvement_justification": "The limitations explicitly state that 'Currently, only where power lines are present, and where electromagnetic fields may occur, are indicated. Modelling of impact on ecosystem components should therefore be performed with caution.' and 'An extensive inventory of the design of the cables and site-specific conditions is required to determine the surface propagation of the electromagnetic fields.' The recommendations further suggest to 'Gather additional attribution detailing the type of cable and design and method of deployment / installation' and 'Determine the positional accuracy of the data and gather references and empirical evidence that can be used to validate assumptions made about the spatial impact of EMF from cables.' This indicates a fundamental gap in the layer's ability to represent the actual spatial impact of EMF, moving beyond simple presence/absence to a more nuanced understanding of field propagation and intensity. This requires substantial new data collection (cable design, deployment, site-specific conditions) and potentially a fundamental methodological overhaul to model EMF propagation, which aligns with 'large' improvement potential.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements, particularly gathering 'additional attribution detailing the type of cable and design and method of deployment / installation' and conducting an 'extensive inventory' to determine EMF propagation, would require significant resources, advanced technical expertise (e.g., in electromagnetic modeling), and extensive coordination with cable operators and potentially new data collection efforts. Validating assumptions about spatial impact would also involve empirical evidence, which can be costly and complex to acquire. This aligns with 'high' difficulty.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing cannot directly detect or measure electromagnetic fields from underwater cables. While satellites can map some aspects of the marine environment (e.g., bathymetry in shallow waters, sea surface temperature, chlorophyll), they do not have the capability to sense sub-surface infrastructure like power cables or the electromagnetic fields they generate. The data required for improvement (cable design, deployment, site-specific conditions, and EMF propagation) are not observable from space.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden's primary datasets (Sentinel-2 Level-2A and national land cover data) are optical and primarily focused on terrestrial and shallow coastal environments. They are not capable of detecting underwater power cables or their electromagnetic fields. The data needed for improvement, such as detailed cable specifications, deployment methods, and empirical measurements of EMF, are entirely outside the scope and capabilities of DigitalEarthSweden's current offerings."

    "summary": "This raster intends to show predicted sound level exposure at a frequency of 125 Hertz from wind power in Swedish coastal and offshore waters. A cell value of 0 is equivalent to low exposure (<100dB re 1 uPa) and a cell value of 100 is equivalent to high exposure (>150 dB re 1 uPa). The maximum noise level is based on values recorded during during strong winds at Lillegrund windfarm (7km from Oresund Bridge) and these maximum values are used as proxy for yearly average noise emissions. The modelled noise pressure should therefore be considered to be a very conservative (loud) estimation of the noise pollution from wind power. Underlying data are from several sources and consist of offshore wind farm data, bottom substrate data, and depth data that have been combined and modelled. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",
    "summary_swedish": "Detta rasterskikt avser att visa beräknad ljudexponering från vindkraft i frekvensområdet 125 Hertz i svenska kust- och havsvatten. Ett cellvärde av 0 motsvarar låg exponering (<100 dB re 1 uPa), och ett cellvärde av 100 motsvarar hög exponering (>150 dB re 1 uPa). Den maximala ljudnivån baseras på värden som registrerats under starka vindar vid Lillegrunds vindkraftpark (7 km från Oresundsbron) och dessa maximala värden används som proxy för årliga genomsnittliga bullerutsläpp. Det modellerade bullertrycket bör därför anses vara en mycket konservativ (hög) uppskattning av bullerföroreningen från vindkraft. Underlagsdata härrör från flera olika källor och består av havsbaserad vindkraftsparksdata, bottensubstratsdata och djupdata som kombinerats och modellerats. Denna data skapades som ett data input layer för ’Symphony’ verktyget utvecklat av enheten för havsplaneringen på Havs- och vattenmyndigheten (HaV). Symphony används av HaV för bedömning av den kumulativa miljöpåverkan av mänsklig aktivitet i svenska vatten och används vid havsplanering. Återanvändning av denna data för andra ändamål är endast\nlämpligt efter vägledning och rådgivning av datakällorna.",
    "lineage": "With the assistance of a generalised spreading model (RL = SL – TL) the Received Level (RL) of sound was calculated for all cells in the SYMPHONY at a frequency of 125 Hz. SL = Source level. Transmission loss (TL) was calculated as a function of the distance from the source (distance) as well as bottom substrate character at the source. For shallow (<30M) bottom with hard sediment character the function 15 × log(distance) was used and for other conditions the function 20 × log(distance) was used. Bottom substrate classification was based on maps of bottom substrate purpose produced by the Geological Survey of Sweden (SGU) for SYMPHONY. Bottom substrates where the proportion of soft bottom was > 50% were defined as having soft sediment character. The aggregated sound from all wind power turbines over a year were combined and converted to sound intensity. The yearly average was calculated and then converted to sound volume expressed in average decibels (dBavg), which was calculated as follows: dBavg =10 × log10(∑∆t/T×(10)^((RL intensity/10)) summed over all ∆t under the whole time period T (1 year alternatively 6 months). The source sound volume that was applied was 136 dB at a frequency of 127 Hz (integrated over the frequency range 123 – 132 Hz), which was measured at Lillgrund as a conservative ‘worst case’ in the upper range for existing wind power turbines. The values for the wind power park at Middelgrunden, Bockstigen and Vindeby demonstrate source volumes < 136 dB (Miller, 2009, Underwater noise from three types of offshore wind turbines, Andersson et al, 2011, Vindval rapport 6436). A value of 114 dB at a one-third octave band centered on 125 Hz has been specified for Middelgrunden which further emphasises that the proposed value of 136 dB constitutes a conservative assumption for wind power turbine. Data were linear normalized between 100 and 150 dB yearly average. More detailed information on the lineage and methodology is available and can be supplied on request to the data owner.",
    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "Attention should be paid to the underlying quality and accuracy of the sediment substrate data. In particular the Geological Survey of Sweden (SGU) provided data on the probability of occurrence of soft sediment substrates for these modelling, these data are based on both on dominant grain size and categorical maps based on hydroacoustic data. The model does not include information on sediment compaction and morphology which will certainly affect sound propagation. This model should therefore be used with caution and should not be\nused for detailed studies of smaller areas.\nThe model should be used with caution outside Sweden within HavExtend, because there\nare modelled positions for the wind power plant and because the confidence in the substrate\ndata is lower.",
    "recommendations_for_data_improvement": "s. Sound propagation models can be made considerably more complicated and \"heavy\". Modulated data has been checked against validated model for Lillgrund and there is a slight difference due to the use of generalized sound propagation factors. In the case of wind turbines, noise levels are low, which may mean that this minor error is not considered to be so important for the analysis in Symphony. Note that the noise relates only to wind turbines without masking or other effects. In reality, many other sounds occur in the ocean. If you want to develop the data set, you can develop a site-specific sound spread factor and turbine- specific source noise for each wind farm, but this is much more time-consuming and costly.",

Recommendations include developing biogeochemical components for the inshore model, including spatial data on drivers for improved resolution, and producing associated quality maps based on error values. These require fundamental methodological overhauls and potentially new data collection/modeling approaches.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommendations would require significant effort. Developing biogeochemical components for the inshore model and incorporating spatial drivers for improved resolution implies advanced modeling techniques and potentially new data integration. Producing combined national geodata products at source (SMHI) and creating quality maps based on error values would require extensive coordination, advanced technical expertise in data fusion and error propagation, and potentially new infrastructure or agreements between agencies. This goes beyond simple updates or integration of existing data.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can contribute to improving this layer, particularly for water quality parameters. Ocean color sensors can provide data on chlorophyll-a (a proxy for eutrophication), suspended particulate matter, and potentially colored dissolved organic matter, which are all related to water quality and nutrient levels. While direct nitrogen concentration is not typically measured by satellite, proxies and related parameters can be derived, helping to validate models or provide spatial context, especially in coastal zones where in-situ data might be sparse. However, direct measurement of nitrogen background levels is not a primary satellite capability.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden, primarily offering Sentinel-2 data and national land cover, has limited direct applicability to improving this specific marine layer. Sentinel-2 is optical and has limited penetration in water, making it less suitable for deep offshore water column data. While it can assist with coastal land use and development (which might indirectly influence coastal nitrogen), it does not provide direct measurements or models for water column nitrogen concentrations or biogeochemical processes in marine environments. Its capabilities are more focused on terrestrial and shallow coastal mapping, not the marine water column chemistry that forms the core of this layer."

      "improvement_justification": "The layer has significant limitations, including merging data from different temporal periods (offshore 2005-2014, inshore 1999-2008), very low spatial resolution for inshore data, and inclusion of offshore data with high error thresholds (up to 50%). The recommendations suggest fundamental methodological overhauls, such as improving the SMHI coastal zone model's eutrophication component, normalizing data to natural background levels, developing biogeochemical components for the inshore model (like SCOBI), including spatial data on drivers for improved inshore resolution, and producing combined national geodata products at source with associated quality maps. These are not minor tweaks but require substantial re-conceptualization and advanced modeling.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements would be highly difficult. It involves developing new biogeochemical models (e.g., SCOBI-like for inshore), integrating spatial drivers, normalizing data to natural background levels (which itself is complex), and producing combined national geodata products with error maps directly from SMHI. This requires significant resources, advanced technical expertise in marine biogeochemical modeling, extensive coordination between different agencies (SMHI, SwAM), and potentially new data collection or re-analysis of existing data with new methodologies. The current approach of merging disparate datasets with known limitations suggests a need for a more integrated and robust modeling framework.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can significantly help improve this layer, particularly for water quality parameters. Ocean color sensors can provide data on chlorophyll-a (a proxy for phytoplankton biomass and eutrophication), suspended particulate matter, and potentially colored dissolved organic matter, which are all relevant to phosphorus dynamics and eutrophication. While direct phosphorus concentration is not typically measured by satellite, the proxies can help validate models, identify areas of high productivity or turbidity, and potentially improve the spatial resolution and temporal coverage of inshore and offshore water quality assessments, especially for eutrophication which is highlighted as crucial for model improvement. Satellite data could also help in mapping coastal land use and land-water interactions that drive phosphorus inputs.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden, through its Sentinel-2 Level-2A data products and national land cover data, can contribute to improving this layer. Sentinel-2's multi-spectral bands can be used for coastal water quality monitoring, such as detecting algal blooms (related to eutrophication), mapping suspended sediments, and potentially identifying land-based sources of pollution in coastal areas. The national land cover data can provide crucial spatial information on land use, agricultural areas, and urban development in coastal zones, which are significant drivers of phosphorus runoff into coastal waters. This spatial data on drivers, as recommended, could help improve the spatial resolution and accuracy of the inshore model, especially concerning land-water interactions. While not directly measuring phosphorus, these datasets can provide valuable contextual and input data for improved modeling and validation of phosphorus concentrations, particularly in the coastal zone where land-based influences are strong."

    "summary": "The raster layer intends to show the mean predicted catch of benthic fish by bottom trawling in Swedish coastal and offshore waters. A cell value of 0 is equivalent to no benthic fish catch by bottom trawling and a cell value of 100 is equivalent to high mean catch (SAR ≥ 8.196288). Underlying data are from two sources and consist of Surface Area Ratio (SAR) of trawling (OSPAR 2009-2013, and HELCOM 2009-2015) data. The surface area ratios (SAR) of trawling are produced by summing total swept area of trawling within a measurement area and then normalize the swept area to the measurement area. Assuming that within the measurement area the trawling is evenly distributed the surface area ratio is interpreted as the number of times per unit of time the measurement area is trawled over. The swept area for a specific fishing vessel is estimated using modelled trawl door spread (for a specific fishery/gear) multiplied by the vms (vessel monitoring system) speed and vms ping interval for a vms signal/position representing benthic trawling. The total swept area within a measurement area is then the sum of all swept area positions, from all vessels within a measurement area. For these data a linear relationship between trawl intensity SAR and catch is assumed this relationship is not modelled using logbook or landings data so this is a simplistic assumption. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",

Ett cellvärde av 0 motsvarar inget fiske genom bottentrålning, och ett cellvärde av 100 motsvarar hög ansträngning (SAR ≥ 8,196288). Underlagsdata härrör från\ntvå källor och består av SAR (Surface Area Ratio) från\ntrålning (OSPAR 2009-2013 och HELCOM 2009-2015).\nSAR för trålning skapas genom att summera den totala arean\nsom trålats inom ett mätområde och sedan normaliseras det\ntrålade området till mätområdet. Det antas att trålningen\ninom mätområdet är jämnt fördelad, varvid SAR tolkas som\nantalet gånger per tidsenhet som området trålats. Det\ntrålade området för ett specifikt fiskefartyg beräknas genom\nmodellerad tråldörrsspridning (för ett specifikt\nfiske/redskap) multiplicerat vms-hastighet (vessel\nmonitoring system) hastighet och vms-pingintervall för en\nvms-signal/position som representerar bentisk trålning.

Standardized products on surface area ratio (SAR) of trawling were downloaded from the working group link on ICES homepage. The method is described in the working group reports (ICES Working Group Spatial Fisheries Data report 2016), but in short the SAR of trawling are produced by summing total swept area of trawling within a measurement area and then normalize the swept area to the measurement area. Assuming that within the measurement area the trawling is evenly distributed the SAR is interpreted as the number of times per unit of time the measurement area is trawled over. The swept area for a specific fishing vessel is estimated using modelled trawl door spread (for a specific fishery/gear) multiplied by the vms speed and vms ping interval for a vms signal/position representing fishery. The total swept area within a measurement area is then the sum of all swept area positions, from all vessels within a measurement area. The underlying data has been aggregated yearly on a\ngeographic grid of resolution 0.05 degree (approximately 1.5\nx 3 nm square at 57 N). Yearly data on total SAR are\nproduced in the HELCOM (the Baltic including Kattegat)\nand OSPAR (North East Atlantic incl. Kattegat) region\nrespectively. Data are available for the years 2009 – 2013 in\nthe HELCOM region and 2009-2015 in the OSPAR region.\nData are available as spatial polygons.\nEach year’s polygon dataset were projected into the\nSymphony projection ETRS1989 LAEA. Further the\npolygons were rasterized on the symphony grid using mean\nvalues if several polygons overlay the same raster grid cell.\nAverages of SAR values are calculated (introducing zero\nvalues in NA raster cells) over the time periods (2009-2015\nfor OSPAR and 2009-2013 for HELCOM) and the Kattegat\narea where masked from the HELCOM data set. Finally the\ntwo data sets were added and save as\n'Bottom_trawling_intensity_mean_SAR.tif'\nFrom this underlying data set, representing swept area of\nbottom trawlers, a linear response proxy was derived\nrepresenting outtake of bottom fish. The raster was\nnormalized by dividing the data set by the maximum SAR\nvalue in the Swedish exclusive economic zone (EEZ):\nmaxEEZ SAR = 8.196288\nUncertainty of this layer is set to 0.5 representing a “good”\nmodel, in the whole region as the data are almost complete\ninternational data (representing vessels >12 m), they are\naverages over several years and thus represent a large part of\nthe total trawling effort and resource outtake but aggregated\ninto larger cells (0.05 degree resolution) and partly\nvalidated.

      "improvement_justification": "The primary limitation is the simplistic assumption of a linear relationship between trawl intensity (SAR) and catch, which is explicitly stated as 'not modelled using logbook or landings data' and 'more fishing effort will not necessarily lead to more catch - this could easily be the inverse'. This is a fundamental flaw in the layer's core premise (predicting catch from SAR). The recommendation to 'Investigate the possibility of modelling the between benthic trawling effort and catch' points to a need for a complete re-conceptualization of how catch is estimated, moving beyond a simple linear proxy to a more robust, data-driven model incorporating actual catch data. This constitutes a major methodological overhaul.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Modelling the relationship between benthic trawling effort (SAR) and actual catch (from logbook/landings data) is a complex task. It requires integrating disparate datasets (VMS-derived SAR with logbook/landings data), potentially from multiple fleets (Swedish and foreign), and accounting for various factors influencing catch rates (e.g., stock abundance, gear efficiency, environmental conditions, fishing strategy). This would involve advanced statistical or machine learning techniques, significant data harmonization, and potentially new data collection or access agreements. The recommendation also highlights the need to 'Investigate if there is a possibility to have consistent data (temporal periods) for OSPAR and HELCOM fisheries datasets', which adds another layer of data integration complexity. This is a new methodology of large complexity with no established techniques for this specific problem.",
      "satellite_justification": "The layer focuses on benthic fish catch by bottom trawling, which is an activity occurring on or near the seafloor. The underlying data (VMS, trawl door spread, swept area) are derived from vessel-based monitoring systems and fishing gear characteristics. Satellite remote sensing, while excellent for surface phenomena (e.g., SST, chlorophyll, ocean color, surface currents), cannot directly observe or measure benthic fish populations, trawl activity on the seafloor, or actual fish catch. While satellites can track vessel movements (AIS), the VMS data used here are more detailed for fishing activity. Therefore, satellite data cannot directly generate or significantly improve this layer's core content (benthic fish catch).",

These datasets are suitable for terrestrial and shallow coastal applications (e.g., land use, vegetation, coastal mapping, shallow water habitat detection in clear waters). However, they have no capability to monitor or derive information about benthic fish populations, bottom trawling activity, or fish catch in offshore or deeper coastal waters.

      "improvement_justification": "The layer explicitly states 'Spatially detailed information of passive gears...is generally lacking' and 'not validated nor modelled at a high resolution'. Recommendations include using AIS data for additional spatial information and gathering data for validation and higher resolution modelling. This points to a need for fundamental methodological overhauls and new data collection protocols to address significant spatial data gaps and improve model resolution and validation, which aligns with 'large' improvement potential.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommendations, particularly using AIS data for spatial information on small-scale fishing fleets and gathering data for validation and higher resolution modeling, would require significant resources, advanced technical expertise (e.g., processing large AIS datasets, developing new spatial models for passive gear), and extensive coordination (e.g., with fishing industry, data providers). This aligns with 'high' difficulty.",
      "satellite_justification": "While direct detection of gillnet catch or effort from satellites is not feasible, satellite remote sensing, specifically Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, can be used to detect and track fishing vessels, including smaller vessels that might use passive gear, especially when combined with AIS data. This could help gather 'additional spatial information' as recommended. Additionally, satellite-derived environmental parameters (e.g., sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a) could potentially be used in higher-resolution predictive models for fish distribution, which could indirectly improve the 'mean predicted catch' layer, although the primary limitation is gear effort data.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden primarily offers Sentinel-2 optical data and national land cover data. These datasets are not directly applicable to monitoring offshore fishing activity, detecting fishing gear, or providing data on fish catch/effort in marine waters. Sentinel-2's capabilities are limited to coastal and terrestrial applications, and it cannot track vessels or provide marine biological data relevant to this layer's core limitations."

    "lineage": "Data are from pelagic trawling and seining are used as a proxy for outtake of pelagic fish resources. Due to lack of updated and reliable data on pelagic fishery from the ICES / HELCOM data produced by ICES WGSFD and total lack of pelagic data in the available ICES / OSPAR data set, two different unofficial data sets where used to produce the pelagic fishing layer. A one year (2014) AIS derived data set on international pelagic trawlers (OTM / PTM) from the Baltic including the Kattegat area were combined with Swedish logbook data from the Skagerrak area including purse seiners (PS) and pelagic trawlers (OTM / PTM). The AIS data set represented kW*hours aggregated on a 1 km x1 km grid. The Skagerrak data used where positioned (each fishing\nevent, i.e. trawl haul is reported to degree minute precision)\nlogbook reported fishing hours multiplied with engine size.\nThe data where aggregated on a 5 km x 5 km grid and\naverages over time period 2010-2015 where produced. The\nlarger scale is due to the lower spatial resolution of the\nlogbook information compared to the AIS data used in the\nBaltic. The pelagic trawling effort in the Skagerrak where\nthen raised to total effort per ICES statistical rectangle to\naccount for Danish pelagic fishing hours using official\nnumbers of trawling effort per ICES rectangle reported by\nthe EU. This procedure excluded seining as this is mainly a\ncoastal fishery to which Danish fishermen don’t have access.\nFinally the Skagerrak layer was disaggregated to a 1 km x 1\nkm sized grid and added to the Baltic AIS layer.\nBefore normalization the OTM_1km_grid date where\ndisaggregated into the symphony grid (250 m x 250 m). The\nraster was normalized by dividing the data set by the\nmaximum trawler effort value in the Swedish exclusive\neconomic zone (EEZ):\nmaxEEZ trawler effort = 2103.768 kWh\nAfter normalizing data with maxEEZ all values >1 where set\nto 1.\nPelagic fishery outtake is assumed to be linearly proportional\nto the pelagic effort, expressed as kW*fishing hours. This\nrelationship is also assumed to be similar for seiners and\npelagic trawler.\nDespite the relatively high spatial resolution of data, the\nuncertainty of this layer is set to 0.75 representing a “bad”\nmodel, not validated.\nThe reason to place a higher uncertainty here compared to\nthe Bottom trawling is the fact that, only one year of data is\nused in the Baltic and the AIS data are not official positional\ndata (like VMS) coupled to logbook information on gear,\nmétiers etc, several gears are combined using simple\nassumptions, different scales of the underlying data are\ncombined. Also the Skagerrak data are produce based on the\ntotal fishery in the area, assuming that the Danish fishery is\nlocated exactly where the Swedish vessels operate.",
    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "In the Baltic this data links AIS records (rather than VMS) of pelagic trawl activity to Swedish logbook (landings) data. Only one year of AIS records are used (from 2014). AIS are only required to be carried on vessels over 15m (in contrast to 12m for VMS) and the activity is only linked to Swedish catch data. This is corrected in the Skaggerak where there is significant Danish fleet activity in Swedish\nwaters by utilising ICES landing data. However, these ICES catch data in contrast have a\nsignificantly lower spatial resolution.\nIn the Kattegat no spatial data are utilised other than the logbook data (60x60nm).",

      "improvement_justification": "The layer has significant limitations, including reliance on a single year of AIS data (2014) for the Baltic, use of unofficial data sets, combination of different data scales and types (AIS vs. logbook), and assumptions about Danish fleet activity. The stated uncertainty of 0.75 ('bad model, not validated') indicates a fundamental need for improvement in data sources, methodology, and validation. Recommendations explicitly call for gathering data for validation and higher resolution modeling, and investigating additional spatial information, suggesting a need for substantial overhaul rather than minor tweaks.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements would be difficult. It requires gathering new, more reliable, and higher-resolution data for validation and modeling, potentially from multiple international sources (e.g., more comprehensive AIS/VMS data, official logbook data across fleets). Addressing the spatial resolution discrepancies and combining disparate data types (AIS, logbook, ICES) in a more robust way, along with validating the model, would require significant technical expertise, extensive coordination with various agencies (e.g., ICES, national fisheries authorities), and substantial resource investment.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing is unlikely to directly help generate or significantly improve this layer. The layer focuses on fishing effort (kWh) and predicted catch of pelagic fish, which are primarily derived from vessel tracking data (AIS/VMS) and logbook records. While satellites can monitor vessel activity (e.g., through VMS or synthetic aperture radar for larger vessels), they cannot directly measure fishing effort in kWh or fish catch. They also cannot provide the detailed species-specific or gear-specific information needed for this layer. The layer's core data needs are in-situ vessel activity and catch data, not environmental parameters typically measured by satellites.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden's primary datasets (Sentinel-2 Level-2A and national land cover data) are not suitable for generating or improving this marine fishing effort and catch layer. Sentinel-2 is an optical sensor primarily for land and shallow coastal waters, and it cannot track fishing vessel activity or measure fish catch in offshore pelagic environments. The national land cover data is terrestrial. The layer requires specific marine fisheries data (vessel tracking, logbooks, catch statistics) that are outside the scope of DigitalEarthSweden's current offerings."

    "summary": "The raster layer intends to show turdbidity as a consequnce of bottom trawling in Swedish coastal and offshore waters. A cell value of 0 is equivalent to no turbidity due to bottom trawling and a cell value of 100 is equivalent to high turbidity. Underlying data are from two sources and consist of Surface Area Ratio (SAR) of trawling (OSPAR 2009-2013, and HELCOM 2009-2015) data. The surface area ratios (SAR) of trawling are produced by summing total swept area of trawling within a measurement area and then normalize the swept area to the measurement area. Assuming that within the measurement area the trawling is evenly distributed the surface area ratio is interpreted as the number of times per unit of time the measurement area is trawled over. The swept area for a specific fishing vessel is estimated using modelled trawl door spread (for a specific fishery/gear) multiplied by the vms (vessel monitoring system) speed and vms ping interval for a vms signal/position representing benthic trawling. The total swept area within a measurement area is then the sum of all swept area positions, from all vessels within a measurement area. For these data a linear relationship between trawl intensity SAR and turbidity is assumed. This relationship is not validated empirically so it is a simplistic assumption. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters\nand this informs the formulation of policy at plan area\nscales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only\nadvisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",
    "summary_swedish": "Detta rasterskikt avser att visa bottentrål grumlighet i svenska kust- och havsvatten. Ett cellvärde av 0 motsvarar inget bottentrålning, och ett cellvärde av 100 motsvarar intensiv bottentrålning (SAR ≥ 8,196288). Underlagsdata härrör från två källor och består av SAR (Surface Area Ratio) från trålning (OSPAR 2009-2013 och HELCOM 2009-2015). SAR för trålning skapas genom att summera den totala arean som trålats inom ett mätområde och sedan normaliseras det trålade området till mätområdet. Det antas att trålningen inom mätområdet är jämnt fördelad, varvid SAR tolkas som antalet gånger per tidsenhet som området trålats. Det trålade området för ett specifikt fiskefartyg beräknas genom modellerad tråldörrsspridning (för ett specifikt fiske/redskap) multiplicerat vms-hastighet (vessel monitoring system) hastighet och vms-pingintervall för en vms-signal/position som representerar bentisk trålning. Det totala trålade området inom mätområdet är då summan av alla trålade områden, från alla fartyg inom mätområdet. För dessa data antas ett linjärt förhållande mellan trålningsintensitets-SAR och grumling, detta förhållande är inte testad. Denna data skapades som ett data input layer för ’Symphony’ verktyget utvecklat av enheten för havsplaneringen på Havs- och vattenmyndigheten (HaV). Symphony används av HaV för bedömning av den kumulativ+L11a miljöpåverkan av mänsklig aktivitet i svenska vatten och används vid havsplanering. Återanvändning av denna data för andra ändamål är endast lämpligt efter vägledning och rådgivning av datakällorna.",
    "lineage": "Data are internationally collected data on bottom trawling impact produced by the ICES working group on spatial fisheries data (ICES WGSFD). Standardized products on surface area ratio (SAR) of trawling were downloaded from the working group link on ICES homepage. The method is described in the working group reports (ICES Working Group Spatial Fisheries Data report 2016), but in short the SAR of trawling are produced by summing total swept area of trawling within a measurement area and then normalize the swept area to the measurement area. Assuming that within the measurement area the trawling is evenly distributed the SAR is interpreted as the number of times per unit of time the measurement area is trawled over. The swept area for a specific fishing vessel is estimated using modelled trawl door spread (for a specific fishery/gear)\nmultiplied by the vms speed and vms ping interval for a vms\nsignal/position representing fishery. The total swept area\nwithin a measurement area is then the sum of all swept area\npositions, from all vessels within a measurement area.\nThe underlying data has been aggregated yearly on a\ngeographic grid of resolution 0.05 degree (approximately 1.5\nx 3 nm square at 57 N). Yearly data on total SAR are\nproduced in the HELCOM (the Baltic including Kattegat)\nand OSPAR (North East Atlantic incl. Kattegat) region\nrespectively. Data are available for the years 2009 – 2013 in\nthe HELCOM region and 2009-2015 in the OSPAR region.\nData are available as spatial polygons.\nEach year’s polygon dataset were projected into the\nSymphony projection ETRS1989 LAEA. Further the\npolygons were rasterized on the symphony grid using mean\nvalues if several polygons overlay the same raster grid cell.\nAverages of SAR values are calculated (introducing zero\nvalues in NA raster cells) over the time periods (2009-2015\nfor OSPAR and 2009-2013 for HELCOM) and the Kattegat\narea where masked from the HELCOM data set. Finally the\ntwo data sets were added and save as\n'Bottom_trawling_intensity_mean_SAR.tif'\nFrom this underlying data set, representing swept area of\nbottom trawlers, a linear response proxy was derived\nrepresenting outtake of bottom fish. The raster was\nnormalized by dividing the data set by the maximum SAR\nvalue in the Swedish exclusive economic zone (EEZ):\nmaxEEZ SAR = 8.196288\nUncertainty of this layer is set to 0.5 representing a “good”\nmodel, in the whole region as the data are almost complete\ninternational data (representing vessels >12 m), they are\naverages over several years and thus represent a large part of\nthe total trawling effort and resource outtake but aggregated\ninto larger cells (0.05 degree resolution) and partly\nvalidated. Also compared to traditional proxies for bottom\ntrawling like kW*fishing hours, the SAR values takes into\naccount typical trawl widths for different fishing fleets.",

The recommendation is to 'Investigate the relationship between benthic trawling effort, sediment type and turbidity'. This implies a fundamental methodological overhaul and potentially new data collection/integration (sediment type, empirical turbidity measurements) to move beyond a simplistic, unvalidated assumption. This constitutes a major improvement.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Investigating and empirically validating the complex relationship between trawling effort, sediment type, and turbidity would require significant resources, advanced technical expertise (e.g., hydrodynamic modeling, sediment transport modeling), extensive coordination (e.g., field campaigns for turbidity and sediment data collection, integration of diverse datasets), and potentially new methodologies. This is a research-level endeavor, not a simple data update.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can potentially help improve this layer by providing data on turbidity. Optical sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2, MODIS, VIIRS) can measure Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) in surface waters, which is a proxy for turbidity. While bottom trawling primarily affects bottom turbidity, the suspended sediments can disperse and reach the surface, especially in shallower coastal areas. Satellite data could help in empirically validating the spatial extent and intensity of turbidity plumes, and potentially in understanding the relationship between trawling effort and observed turbidity, especially if combined with in-situ measurements and hydrodynamic models. However, direct measurement of bottom turbidity from space is not possible.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden, primarily offering Sentinel-2 Level-2A data and national land cover, has limited direct applicability for improving this specific marine layer. While Sentinel-2 can provide some insights into surface water turbidity in coastal areas, its capabilities are limited to optical properties of the surface water and do not directly address the complex benthic processes or the relationship between trawl intensity and turbidity at depth. The land cover data is irrelevant. DigitalEarthSweden does not provide the specialized marine data (e.g., detailed bathymetry, sediment type maps, or in-situ turbidity measurements) or advanced marine modeling capabilities needed to address the core limitations of this layer."

The recommendation is to determine 'The likelihood of spillage from all potentially hazardous wrecks.' This implies a fundamental re-evaluation and re-modeling of spill probabilities for individual wrecks, moving beyond a generalized approach. This requires substantial new data (individual wreck conditions, oil types, environmental factors) and a complete overhaul of the modeling methodology, which constitutes a 'large' improvement.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements would require significant effort. Determining the 'likelihood of spillage from all potentially hazardous wrecks' would involve detailed assessment of each wreck (e.g., structural integrity, oil type and quantity, environmental conditions at each site). This would likely necessitate new data collection (e.g., surveys of wrecks), advanced modeling techniques beyond the current simplified approach, and extensive coordination with experts (e.g., marine archaeologists, oil spill modelers). This level of effort and expertise qualifies as 'high' difficulty.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can significantly help improve this layer, particularly in validating and refining oil spill probability and spread models. While satellites cannot directly assess the internal state of shipwrecks or the exact quantity/type of oil, they are crucial for: 1. Monitoring actual oil spills: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical sensors can detect oil on the sea surface, providing real-world data on spill occurrences and spread patterns. This data can be used to validate and calibrate the probabilistic models. 2. Environmental parameters: Satellites provide data on sea surface temperature, currents, and wind speed (though the layer specifies a fixed wind speed, real-time or historical wind data from satellites could inform more dynamic models), which are critical inputs for oil spill trajectory and weathering models. 3. Coastal and marine environment mapping: Satellite data can help map sensitive areas (e.g., marine protected areas, bird nesting sites, aquaculture) that would be impacted by spills, allowing for a more nuanced assessment of exposure probability based on environmental vulnerability.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden, with its focus on Sentinel-2 Level-2A data and national land cover, is not directly applicable to improving this specific marine layer. Sentinel-2 is an optical sensor primarily for land and shallow, clear water applications. It lacks the specialized marine sensors (e.g., SAR for oil slick detection, altimeters for sea state, dedicated ocean color sensors for water quality in deeper waters) that would be most beneficial for oil spill modeling and detection. While it could map coastal land use, which might be impacted by spills, it cannot generate or significantly enhance the core 'probability of exposure' layer which is based on offshore wreck data and oil spill dynamics. The national land cover data is also terrestrial-focused."

    "summary": "The dataset intends to show the predicted risk of organic and inorganic toxin contamination in sediment from legacy paper and sawmill waste dumping sites (fiber banks) and associated areas which are affected by this dumping (fiber rich sediments) in Swedish coastal waters. The process chemicals contained within these sediments are often highly toxic containing both organic and inorganic toxins which have been measured at contamination levels that are significantly higher than background levels. This raster is based on data from sites which were surveyed by the Geological Survey of Sweden between 2010 and 2014 in Västernorrland (Northern Sweden). A limitation of this data is the lack of data from unsurveyed sites. A value of 100 represents a high risk for high levels of organic and inorganic toxins in sediments and a value of 0 represents toxins at background levels. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",

Processkemikalierna inom dessa sediment är ofta mycket giftiga, innehållande både organiska och oorganiska miljögifter vilka har uppmäts till föroreningsnivåer som är signifikant högre än bakgrundsnivåer. Lagret är baserat på data från områden undersökta av Sveriges geologiska undersökning (SGU) mellan 2010 och 2014 i Västernorrland. En begränsning är brist på data från ej undersökta områden. Ett värde av 100 motsvarar hög risk för höga nivåer av organiska och oorganiska miljögifter i sediment, och ett värde av 0 motsvarar miljögifter på bakgrundsnivå. Denna data skapades som ett data input layer för ’Symphony’ verktyget utvecklat av enheten för havsplaneringen på Havs- och vattenmyndigheten (HaV). Symphony används av HaV för bedömning av den kumulativa miljöpåverkan av mänsklig aktivitet i svenska vatten och används vid havsplanering.

Satellite remote sensing, while excellent for surface phenomena (e.g., water quality indicators like chlorophyll, turbidity, SST), cannot directly measure heavy metal concentrations or organic toxins within sediments. While some indirect indicators might exist (e.g., changes in benthic habitat if severe contamination leads to visible degradation), these are not direct measurements and would not be sufficient to generate or significantly improve this specific layer's core data on sediment contamination levels. The primary need is for in-situ sediment sampling and analysis.",

These datasets are valuable for mapping coastal land use, habitat changes, and general environmental monitoring, but they do not provide direct information on heavy metal or organic toxin concentrations in marine sediments.

    "summary": "This raster intends to show the predicted risk of inorganic toxin (mercury) contamination in sediments associated with licenced mercury waste dumping. In the 1960s and 1970s an estimated 23,000 barrels containing contaminated mercury waste were legally (at that time no regulation was in place) dumped in a deep water dumping site in aproximately 80m of water outside of Sundsvall in Northern Sweden. In 2006 the Geological Survey of Sweden undertook a survey of this dumping site and identified approximately 3500 barrels. This raster is modelled based on the positional data from that survey (the site and barrels in surrounding waters buffered by 1km) to provide an indication of the risk of mercury contamination. A value of 100 represents a high risk for high levels of organic and inorganic toxins in sediments and a value of 0 represents toxins at background level. Note that only 3500 barrels were found in the 2006 survey so there is uncertainty surrounding the location of the remaining barrels. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",
    "summary_swedish": "Detta rasterskikt avser att visa beräknad risk för oorganiska miljögifter (kvicksilver) i sediment i samband med licensierad kvicksilverdumpning. Under 1960- och 1970- talet dumpades uppskattningsvis 23 000 tunnor\ninnehållande förorenat kvicksilveravfall lagligt (vid denna\ntidpunkt fanns ingen reglering av dumpning) i ett\ndjupvattensområde på ungefär 80 meters djup utanför\nSundsvall i norra Sverige. Under 2006 genomförde Sveriges\ngeologiska undersökning (SGU) en undersökning av detta\ndumpningsområde och identifierade uppskattningsvis 3500\ntunnor. Detta rasterskikt är modellerat baserat på\npositionsdata från undersökningen (plats och tunnor i\nomgivande vatten i en buffertzon av 1 km) för att ge en\nindikation på risken för kvicksilverförorening. Ett värde av\n100 motsvarar hög risk för höga nivåer av organiska och\noorganiska miljögifter i sediment, och ett värde av 0\nmotsvarar miljögifter på bakgrundsnivå. Observera att\nendast 3500 tunnor återfanns under undersökningen från\n2006, så osäkerhet finns angående position av återstående\ntunnor. Denna data skapades som ett data input layer för\n’Symphony’ verktyget utvecklat av enheten för\nhavsplaneringen på Havs- och vattenmyndigheten (HaV).\nSymphony används av HaV för bedömning av den\nkumulativa miljöpåverkan av mänsklig aktivitet i svenska\nvatten och används vid havsplanering.

      "improvement_justification": "The layer explicitly states that only 3500 of an estimated 23,000 barrels were found, leading to a 'significant underestimate of the risk'. The model is simplistic, assuming risk decreases with distance from observed barrels, which is a major limitation given the vast number of unlocated barrels. Addressing this requires locating the remaining barrels or developing a more sophisticated predictive model, which would be a fundamental overhaul.",
      "difficulty_justification": "The primary recommendation is to 'undertake additional surveys to gather more data'. Locating 19,500 missing barrels in deep water (80m) over a potentially wide area is a highly complex and resource-intensive task, requiring specialized marine survey equipment (e.g., AUVs, ROVs, advanced sonar) and extensive ship time. Developing a more robust predictive model without direct observation of all barrels would also be challenging, requiring advanced oceanographic and sediment transport modeling.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing cannot directly detect mercury barrels or mercury contamination in deep-sea sediments. Satellite capabilities are primarily focused on surface or near-surface phenomena (e.g., ocean color, SST, surface currents, coastal land features). While some satellite-derived data (e.g., bathymetry in very shallow, clear waters) exist, they are not applicable to 80m deep-water barrel detection or sediment contamination. In-situ measurements, acoustic surveys, and sediment sampling are required.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden, primarily offering Sentinel-2 optical data and national land cover, is not suitable for this layer. Sentinel-2 cannot penetrate deep water to detect barrels or measure sediment contamination. Its focus is on terrestrial and shallow coastal environments. The data required for improving this layer (deep-water surveys, sediment chemistry) are outside the scope of DigitalEarthSweden's current offerings and capabilities."

The underlying data shows areas which were mined during world war two as polygon data. This derived dataset makes the assumption that some sediment contamination may have resulted from this activity. A cell value of 100 represents a high risk for high levels of inorganic toxins in sediments, due to uncertainty associated with impact of mining activity these data are down weighted so a historical presence of a mined area will score 30 (i.e. low risk) and a value of 0 represents toxins at background level.

The underlying data was sourced from HELCOM in the form of point, line and polygon shapefiles detailing the location of dumping grounds, risk areas and dredged munitions. The dataset is modelled using a simplistic assumption of decreasing risk with distance from the dump sites. value of 100 represents a high risk for high levels of organic and inorganic toxins in sediments and a value of 0 represents toxins at background level. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only\nadvisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",

Ett värde av 100 motsvarar hög risk för höga nivåer av organiska och oorganiska miljögifter i sediment, och ett värde av 0 motsvarar bakgrundsnivåer av miljögifter.

      "improvement_justification": "The layer explicitly states it is a 'simplistic model based on unverified assumptions' and 'should therefore be treated as a risk layer which should be validated'. The recommendation is to 'gather raw data from research papers and studies' detailing toxin concentrations and 'update the SGUIs or ICES DOME database' and 'SGU interpolation models'. This implies a fundamental overhaul from a simplistic, assumption-based model to an empirically validated, data-driven model, which constitutes a major improvement.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Gathering raw data from numerous research papers, integrating it into existing databases (SGUIs, ICES DOME), and then updating and validating interpolation models is a significant undertaking. It requires extensive data collection, data harmonization, advanced data analysis, and potentially new modeling approaches, which would be resource-intensive and require high technical expertise and coordination.",
      "satellite_justification": "This layer models the risk of organic and inorganic toxin contamination in marine sediments. Satellite remote sensing, while excellent for surface phenomena (e.g., chlorophyll, SST, suspended sediments), cannot directly measure or infer the concentration of specific organic and inorganic toxins within marine sediments. These measurements require in-situ sampling and laboratory analysis.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden primarily provides Sentinel-2 optical imagery and national land cover data. While useful for coastal land use or shallow water habitat mapping, it does not offer capabilities to directly detect or quantify toxic munition contamination in marine sediments. The data needed for this layer (sediment toxin concentrations) are not available through DigitalEarthSweden's current offerings."

A value of 0 is equivalent to a mean concentration of 0 for the 32 organic toxins and a value of 1 is equivalent to mean very high concentrations (Class 5, Naturvårdsverket rapport 4914). The data has been normalised to the likelihood of mud content in surrounding sediments based on the assumption that organic toxins will bind with organic matter in sediment. Outliers have been modelled separately and reintroduced into the dataset. These areas all have recorded organic toxin concentrations at levels significantly above the very-high level and are mapped with a buffer of approximately 15km based on the assumption that proximity to these sites equates to a higher risk of organic toxin pollution. This raster is based on historical sediment data from the Geological Survey of Sweden and International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Variograms modelled individually for each synthetic\ntoxin, best fit model chosen using cross validation.\n11. Data interpolated (gridded) to a 5km grid for each\nsynthetic toxin using ordinary kriging algorithm (Surfer -\nGolden Software). Associated standard deviation layers\ncreated.\n12. All data layers transformed to the same scale using the\nhigh (1) values from the Swedish Environment protection\nagency report No. 4914.\n13. Transformed data layers combined into mean data layer\nusing grid mosaic in Surfer.\n14. Mean data layer normalised to the estimated predicted\nfrequency of organic mud (gyttja) in marine sediments by\nusing a multiplication function in ArcGIS raster calculator.\n15. Final data layer rescaled to 0-1 risk layers in ArcGIS\nusing raster calculator so that values above 1 are reset to one.\n16. Combined standard deviation data layer created by\nscaling standard deviation layers for each synthetic toxin to a\n0-100 scale, combining into a mean layer using grid mosaic\nin Surfer and reclassifying the data into four quantiles in\nArcGIS. Data where the mean error is below 50% are\nassumed to represent a good model (without validation).\nData where the mean error is above 50% are assumed to\nrepresent a poor model / interpolation, cells with sample\ndata are included as being highly reliable.",
    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "There are a number of key limitations users should be aware of when using this dataset: 1) Data collected by SGU after 2010 were not available to be included in this model. This includes data from fiberbank surveys undertaken by SGU in Northern Sweden between 2010 and 2016. The impact of this limitation has been limited by incorporating an additional modelled layer into Symphony consisting of known / surveyed fiberbanks and fibre rich sediments as toxic areas (scoring 100) with a linear decrease within 10km distance however this is known to highly simplistic (in some areas there is very little heavy metal increase with distance) - it\nalso ignores fiberbanks that have not been mapped.\n2) The geostatistical interpolation method used does not take into account that land will act\nas a barrier.\n3) The data is a historical average for all records in the ICES Dome and SGU databases and\nas such this may not reflect current sediment conditions.\n4) There is a lack of offshore samples so in general offshore areas have a much higher\nuncertainty.\n5) Data are combined based on their historical concentration and not their toxicity.",

      "improvement_justification": "The layer has several fundamental limitations that significantly impact its accuracy and relevance. These include reliance on historical data (1984-2014) that may not reflect current conditions, lack of offshore samples leading to high uncertainty, and a geostatistical interpolation method that doesn't account for land as a barrier. The recommendations explicitly call for updating the model with post-2010 data, using a tool that handles land as a barrier, and potentially shifting from historical averages to more current or toxicity-based indices. These are not minor tweaks but require substantial re-modeling and data integration, pushing it towards a 'large' improvement potential.",
      "difficulty_justification": "While the improvements are substantial, the recommendations suggest using existing data sources (SGU post-2010) and known modeling techniques (e.g., geostatistical tools that handle barriers). The complexity lies in integrating new data, re-running sophisticated interpolation, and potentially re-evaluating the index (concentration vs. toxicity). This requires significant technical expertise and coordination but doesn't necessarily involve entirely new data collection programs or unproven methodologies, placing it in the 'medium' difficulty category.",
      "satellite_justification": "This layer focuses on organic toxin concentrations in marine benthic substrates (sediments). Satellite remote sensing primarily observes surface phenomena (e.g., sea surface temperature, chlorophyll, suspended sediments, surface oil spills). While some satellite data can infer water quality or habitat types, directly measuring or inferring benthic sediment toxin concentrations from space is not currently feasible. These measurements require in-situ sediment sampling and laboratory analysis.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden, with its Sentinel-2 and national land cover data, is primarily focused on terrestrial and shallow coastal land use, vegetation, and land cover changes. It does not provide capabilities for directly measuring or inferring organic toxin concentrations in marine benthic sediments, especially in offshore areas. The data required for this layer (historical sediment samples, chemical analysis) are not available through DigitalEarthSweden's offerings."

A cell value of 0 is equivalent to low potential water contamination (> 1000 m from harbour) and a cell value of 100 is equivalent to potential water contamination (≤ 1000 m from harbour). Underlying data consists of harbour site presence data in the form of shapefiles. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",

Gather empirical data and information (e.g. from SEPA/County Admin monitoring) which can be used to develop and validate a better model of spatial risk of organic toxin pollution. Gather attribute information on for example the area, number of vessel berths, type of shipping etc that could be used to modify the risk levels) and environmental criteria such as data on currents / sediments to model risk depending on site location.",

This requires a complete re-conceptualization of the risk assessment, moving beyond simple proximity to a more sophisticated predictive model, which constitutes a 'large' improvement potential.",

Furthermore, integrating environmental criteria like currents and sediments to model risk depending on site location requires advanced modeling techniques and significant data acquisition and integration, making it 'high' difficulty.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can contribute significantly. For instance, high-resolution optical imagery (e.g., from Sentinel-2 or commercial satellites) can help in defining and scaling 'harbours' by mapping their physical extent, number of berths, and associated infrastructure. Satellite-derived bathymetry could inform shallow water characteristics. While direct 'synthetic toxin' detection is not feasible, proxies like suspended sediment plumes (indicating dredging or discharge) or unusual water discoloration could be monitored. Coastal development and land use changes around harbours, which might influence runoff, can also be tracked. However, direct toxin concentration or current data at the fine scale needed would still require in-situ measurements.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden, with its Sentinel-2 Level-2A data, can directly support several recommendations. Sentinel-2 imagery can be used to map the physical extent of harbours, identify and potentially classify different types of 'harbours' (e.g., based on size of infrastructure, number of visible berths), and monitor coastal development around them. This helps in 'scaling harbours based on size' and 'representing larger harbours as buffered polygon features'. The national land cover data could also provide context for surrounding land use. While it cannot provide empirical toxin data or detailed current models, it can significantly improve the spatial definition and characterization of the 'harbour' input, which is a key limitation."

      "improvement_justification": "The layer's limitations highlight fundamental issues: a simplistic binary risk estimate (1000m buffer), exclusion of upstream effluent releases, and lack of empirical validation. The recommendations suggest a spatially graduated risk model, modeling upstream effluent, gathering empirical monitoring data (water quality, sediment pollution), and incorporating attribute information (e.g., permitted release volumes, environmental criteria like currents/sediments). These are not minor updates but require a complete re-conceptualization of the risk model, integration of diverse new data sources, and potentially advanced hydrological/dispersion modeling, indicating a 'large' improvement potential.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements would be 'high' difficulty. It requires developing a new, spatially graduated risk model (not just a buffer), integrating complex hydrological models for upstream effluent, acquiring and integrating extensive empirical monitoring data from multiple sources (VISS, SGU), and incorporating dynamic environmental criteria like currents and sediment types. This involves significant data acquisition, advanced spatial analysis, potentially new modeling techniques, and extensive coordination across different data providers and scientific disciplines. It goes beyond simple data updates or minor methodological tweaks.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can help improve this layer. While direct measurement of synthetic toxins is not feasible, satellite data can provide crucial environmental criteria that influence toxin dispersion and impact. For example, satellite-derived sea surface temperature and currents (from altimetry, radiometers) can inform dispersion models. Coastal land use and development (from optical imagery like Sentinel-2) can help identify potential industrial sites or areas of high human activity not captured by the 500m coastal buffer. Water quality indicators (e.g., turbidity, chlorophyll-a as proxies for general water health or potential eutrophication linked to industrial discharge) can be monitored by ocean color sensors, providing data for validation or as input to a more sophisticated risk model. While not directly measuring toxins, these parameters are critical for understanding their fate and transport.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden data, specifically Sentinel-2 Level-2A products, can help improve this layer. Sentinel-2 can be used for detailed coastal land use mapping to identify industrial sites or changes in coastal infrastructure that might be sources of pollution, potentially refining the initial selection of sites within 500m of the coast. While not directly measuring toxins, Sentinel-2's multi-spectral bands can provide insights into water turbidity or suspended sediment concentrations in coastal waters, which can be indicators of discharge or altered water quality. The national land cover data can also provide context for land-based industrial activities near the coast. However, its utility is limited by its optical nature (cloud cover, shallow water penetration) and lack of specialized oceanographic sensors for parameters like currents or specific water chemistry."

      "improvement_justification": "The layer explicitly states limitations regarding the lack of information on sediment type, volume extracted, and precise location of material removed. The recommendation is to 'Gather more precise footprint information on the location and volume of aggregates extracted that can be included as source data attribution. These data would allow impact scaling.' This goes beyond simple updates and requires integrating new, more detailed data (precise footprints, volumes) which would significantly enhance the layer's utility for impact assessment. This is a moderate improvement as it refines the core data rather than a complete overhaul.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommendations would require obtaining more granular data from the Geological Survey of Sweden or other sources, which might involve new data agreements, processing more complex spatial data (precise footprints instead of just licensed areas), and potentially developing methods for 'impact scaling' based on volume. This is more than a 'low' difficulty as it involves data integration and methodological refinement, but not a 'high' difficulty as it builds upon existing data sources and concepts.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing is generally not suitable for directly monitoring sub-surface sand extraction volumes or precise extraction footprints in the marine environment. While some very shallow water changes might be detectable with high-resolution optical imagery, the primary data needed (volume, precise sub-surface extraction locations) are not directly observable from space. Satellite-derived bathymetry might show changes in very shallow areas, but not the detailed information on extraction volumes or sediment types required here.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden, primarily offering Sentinel-2 data and national land cover, is not directly applicable to monitoring sub-surface marine sand extraction. Sentinel-2's optical capabilities are limited in water depth and cannot provide information on extraction volumes or precise sub-surface footprints. The national land cover data is terrestrial focused and not relevant for marine sand extraction."

The recommendations suggest including data on dominant current strength and direction, and if available, sediment type, volume, and location. The lineage also states a simplistic assumption of high impact within the site and no impact elsewhere, noting that the spatial footprint is likely lower than predicted. Addressing these fundamental issues would require a significant overhaul of the impact model, moving from a binary presence/absence to a more sophisticated spatial impact model, which constitutes a 'large' improvement.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements, such as integrating current data (publicly available from SMHI/CMEMS and Balance project) and potentially more detailed extraction data, would require moderate technical expertise for data integration and modeling. While the current data is available, incorporating it into a spatial impact model that accounts for dispersal would be a methodological change of moderate complexity. It doesn't require entirely new data collection programs but rather sophisticated use of existing and potentially new detailed extraction data, placing it at 'medium' difficulty.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can significantly help improve this layer. Turbidity, which is directly related to suspended sediments from sand extraction, can be monitored using ocean color sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2, although DigitalEarthSweden's Sentinel-2 is primarily for land, it can detect turbidity in coastal waters). While the layer is about 'potential habitat loss' from 'turbidity sand extraction', the core issue is the dispersal of sediments. Satellite imagery can provide data on suspended sediment concentrations and plumes, which are direct indicators of turbidity and sediment dispersal. This could help validate or refine the spatial footprint of impact, especially if combined with current data. Additionally, satellite-derived current data (e.g., from altimetry or sea surface temperature gradients) could potentially complement in-situ current measurements, though the recommendations point to existing model outputs.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden, primarily offering Sentinel-2 Level-2A data and national land cover, has limited direct applicability for improving this specific layer. While Sentinel-2 can detect suspended sediments in coastal waters, its primary focus and the limitations of optical sensors (cloud cover, water depth penetration) mean it cannot provide the comprehensive current data or detailed extraction volume/type information needed. The national land cover data is irrelevant to offshore sand extraction impacts. Therefore, while Sentinel-2 might offer some supplementary visual evidence of turbidity plumes, it cannot fundamentally address the core limitations or provide the recommended data for current strength/direction or detailed extraction parameters. The recommended current data sources are from dedicated oceanographic models (SMHI/CMEMS, Balance project), not DigitalEarthSweden."

The source data details statistics for two bird species (the Common Eider, Goldeneye) killed in various regions in 2015 in the form of an excel spreadsheet. This data was combined with spatial data for coastal regions assuming hunting occurs all the way to the edge of the territorial limits and these spatial data were used to transform the data to number of individuals killed per hectare. The data were adjusted to be proportional to the whole population for each species, then aggregated and transformed. A cell value of zero represents no individual birds hunted and a cell value of 100 represents the equivalent of 0.001 individuals killed per hectare. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM).

Boundaries data are open data (overview maps) downloaded from the Swedish land registration authority (Lantmäteriet). The data were normalised to the 2015 national population level for each species determined by the 2016 report \"ORNIS SVECICA 26:3–54, 2016\" thereby producing a proportion of the national population depleted by hunting activity. The species data were applied to the boundary polygons from Lantmäteriet according to the location described in the hunting data. The surface area of the polygons was determined using geometry calculator and the normalised value for hunting was divided by the surface area of the relevant polygon in order to produce a proportion of the population killed per hectare.

      "improvement_justification": "The layer has significant limitations regarding spatial resolution, species coverage, and data reporting quality. The recommendations suggest gathering participatory information from hunters, identifying additional species, and determining the quality of hunting data. These improvements require new data collection (e.g., surveys, direct engagement with hunters) and a fundamental re-evaluation of the spatial distribution assumption, moving beyond the current 'all the way to the EEZ' approach. This constitutes a major overhaul of the data source and methodology for spatial allocation.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommendations involves engaging with hunter associations, potentially designing and conducting surveys, and integrating new, more spatially explicit data. While not requiring entirely new, unproven technologies, it does demand significant coordination, data acquisition from non-traditional sources, and methodological adjustments to incorporate more precise spatial information. This is more than just updating existing data or minor methodological tweaks.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing cannot directly measure bird hunting activity or the number of birds killed. While satellites can provide data on habitat characteristics (e.g., coastal land cover, water bodies) that might be relevant to where hunting occurs, they cannot provide the core data on hunting intensity or species-specific kill counts. The primary data needed (hunting statistics, hunter locations) are in-situ human activity data.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden, primarily offering Sentinel-2 imagery and national land cover data, is not directly applicable to improving this layer. Its data focuses on land use, vegetation, and coastal morphology, which are not the primary limitations of this 'Bird hunt' layer. The core issues are the lack of accurate spatial distribution of hunting effort, the limited species coverage, and the quality of reported hunting data, none of which can be addressed by optical satellite imagery or land cover maps."

The core issues are related to vessel traffic detection (which Sentinel-2 cannot do effectively for individual boats) and the estimation of marine pollution from recreational vessels. Sentinel-2's capabilities are more suited for terrestrial and shallow coastal mapping, not for monitoring vessel activity or marine pollution in the open water or from individual recreational boats. The land cover data might help in understanding the context of harbors, but it won't address the fundamental data gaps or methodological issues of the pollution layer itself."

    "summary": "This raster data intends to show predicted noise associated with recreational boating activity in Swedish inshore and offshore waters. The source data are voluntarily transmitted automatic identification system (AIS B) beacon data and locations and size of recreational boat harbours from 2009. A cell value of zero represents no noise from recreational vessels based on the absence of boat traffic and a cell value of 100 represents maximum vessel activity and therefore noise impact. The actual noise level has not been estimated and this data assumes a linear relationship (between activity and noise levels). These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",
    "summary_swedish": "Detta rasterskikt avser att visa ljud i samband med fritidsbåtaktivitet i svenska kust- och havsvatten. Källdata är från frivilligt utsänd AIS B (Automatic Identification System) data, samt data över plats och storlek på fritidsbåtshamnar (2009). Ett cellvärde av 0 motsvarar inget ljud från fritidsbåtar, och ett cellvärde av 100 motsvarar maximal fartygsaktivitet och därmed ljudpåverkan. De faktiska ljudnivåerna har inte uppskattats och denna data antar ett linjärt förhållande (mellan aktivitet och ljudnivåer). Denna data skapades som ett data input layer för ’Symphony’ verktyget utvecklat av enheten för havsplaneringen på Havs- och vattenmyndigheten (HaV). Symphony används av HaV för bedömning av den kumulativa miljöpåverkan av mänsklig aktivitet i svenska vatten och används vid havsplanering. Återanvändning av denna data för andra ändamål är endast lämpligt efter vägledning och rådgivning av datakällorna.",
    "lineage": "1. 2009 AIS recreational boating density data for the busy summer period (June and July) and point data detailing the position of recreational boat harbours and nature harbours were sourced from the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (see report - https://www.naturvardsverket.se/Documents/publikationer/978- 91-620-6376-4.pdf.) 2. AIS polygon data were classed 1-5 within 10 nautical miles from coast. 2. Buffer polygons around ”guest harbours” according to berths\nand distance, and natural harbours according to distance. Classed\n1-5 to approximately correspond to the classes used for the AIS\ndata.\n3. Merge 1 and 2 “highest value wins” (1+5 = 5, 5+5 =5, 3+4=5\netc.)\nMore detailed information on the lineage and methodology is\navailable and can be supplied on request to the data owner.",
    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "This data includes an element of expert assessment, or best guess, in the absence of relevant data and the results should therefore be interpreted with caution. Recreational boat traffic far from the coast has been excluded from data. 18.52 km = 10 distance minutes (Nautical miles). Data were selected to remove bad input. The impact of ports has been classified based on the size of the port and the distance to the port. The actual noise level has not been estimated and this data assumes a linear relationship between boating activity and noise levels. There is no legal requirement for boats to carry an AIS B beacon so the traffic data outside of ports is very likely a underestimate (perhaps a significant underestimate).",
    "recommendations_for_data_improvement": "Use AIS data over a longer time period and produce an average layer to allow for variability in data quality. Attempt to validate the number of vessels carrying AIS B using external observations (e.g. SAR satellite data), additional data (e.g. insurance company reports). Look for data or studies which can validate the link between recreational vessel activity to noise impacts.",

      "improvement_justification": "The layer has fundamental issues that require substantial new data collection and methodological overhauls. The primary data source (AIS B) is acknowledged as a significant underestimate, and the core assumption of a linear relationship between activity and noise is unvalidated. The exclusion of recreational boat traffic far from the coast also represents a significant data gap. Addressing these requires new data streams (e.g., validating AIS B coverage, finding alternative traffic data) and potentially advanced modeling to estimate actual noise levels and their impact, moving beyond a simple linear assumption.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the necessary improvements would be highly difficult. Validating AIS B coverage would require extensive field observations or integration of diverse, potentially proprietary, datasets (e.g., insurance reports). Estimating actual noise levels from vessel activity is a complex acoustical modeling task, requiring specialized expertise and potentially new data collection (e.g., underwater acoustic measurements). Integrating these disparate data sources and developing a robust noise model would require significant resources, advanced technical expertise, and extensive coordination.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can significantly help improve this layer. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites can detect vessels regardless of AIS transmission, providing a means to validate the number of vessels carrying AIS B and potentially estimate overall vessel density, especially in areas where AIS B is sparse. While SAR cannot directly measure noise, it can provide a more accurate representation of vessel activity, which is the basis for the noise estimation. Optical satellites (e.g., Sentinel-2) could potentially assist in mapping recreational harbors and coastal infrastructure, which are inputs to the model, though their primary utility here is less direct than SAR for vessel detection.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden's primary offerings (Sentinel-2 Level-2A and national land cover data) have limited direct applicability to improving this specific marine noise layer. Sentinel-2 is an optical sensor and cannot detect vessels at sea effectively, especially small recreational boats, nor can it directly measure underwater noise or vessel activity. While it could map coastal features like harbors, this is a minor component of the overall improvement needed. The core issues of underestimation of vessel traffic and the lack of actual noise level estimation are beyond the capabilities of DigitalEarthSweden's current datasets."

Detta rasterskikt är modellerat och är baserat på kombinerat årlig AIS data (2015), djupdata från Sjöfartsverket och data över trolig förekomst av mjukbottnar från Sveriges geologiska undersökning. Denna data är baserad på en rad förenklingar och antaganden vilket ger felkällor och osäkerhet. Modellen är inte validerad, dock finns observationsdata i form av offentligt tillgänglig mulitbeam- data från undersökningar i hamnområden som förutspås ha höga nivåer av erosion runt Skåne i södra Sverige, vilket ger viss data som stöd till modellen i tungt trafikerade områden.

    "lineage": "The dataset is based on combined annual 2015 AIS vessel tracking data created by WSP for SWaM's Symphony project. Calculation of induced flow rate at the bottom is based on [Fuehrer M. and Romisch K. 1987. Propeller jet erosion and stability criteria for bottom protection of various constructions. PIANC, Bulletin No. 58.] Erosion has been assumed to occur at current velocities> = 0.3 m / s. Above the critical erosion level (0.3 m / s), erosion has been assumed linearly following the increasing induced flow velocity (closer to deeper propellers). Furthermore, a simplified assumption has been made where erosion increases linearly to the soft bottom / transport bottom portion within each cell of 250 x 250 m. Also, erosion increases linearly to the annual vessel frequency within each corresponding cell. Processing steps are as follows: 1. The combined proportion of the transport base and\nsoftbottom was calculated from the SGU basis\nSUBSTRATKARTOR_V1_SYMPHONY_20160919.\n2. AIS data on the vessel classes of tankers, passenger ships,\ncargo vessels in 2015 were pooled into one layer with the\ntotal vessel intensity per 250 x 250 m grid cell.\n3. Max speed (Vdmax) at a certain depth (d) was calculated\nwith the equation Vdmax = 10.565 * d-1. Where depth values\nwere collected from SGU\nDJUP_SYMPHONY_V2_20160919.\n4: The equation is based on a power function matched to the\nresults of calculations of Vdmax using the relationship set by\nFuehrer & Romisch (Fuehrer M. and Romisch K. 1987.\nPropeller jet erosion and stability criteria for bottom\nprotection of various constructions. PIANC, Bulletin No.\n58.).\nWhen calculating Vdmax, a standard vessel has been used\nfor which the following assumptions have been made:\nPropeller diameter: 7.5 m (no rudder).,Propeller location:\n4.15 m below water level, Rotation speed: 80 rpm\n(equivalent to about 14.5 knots), Vessel size: L 330 m, W\n50m, D 15 m, E (constant): 0.21 (applicable to ships without\nrudders), Thrust coefficient: 0.45 (chart for advance no J\n0.45) (MAN, Basic Principles of Ship Propulsion)\nAccording to Hjulströms diagram, flow rates above 5 m / s\ncan move all types of sediments (up to blocks). Values above\n5 m / s are not relevant why a threshold was applied at 5 m /\ns (all values above the threshold were given value 5 m / s.\nErosion on semi-finite sediment bottoms can occur at\ninduced current velocities of about 0.3 m / s (wheel flow\ndiagram), why a lower threshold was placed at this flow rate.\n4. All components in the model affect the degree of erosion\nof bottom sediment, i.e.: intensity of vessel traffic,\nproportion of fine / half-sediment and deep-specific\npotential flow rate were pooled by multiplying.\n5. The final grid was normalized linearly between min 0 and\nmax 100\n\"",
    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "The model is constructed to predict vessel thrust velocities that are likely to cause erosion and this calculation is based on a set of simple assumptions. The first is that all vessels have the same characteristics, the second, that erosion is assumed to occur at current velocities> = 0.3 m / s. Thirdly, that above the critical erosion level (0.3 m / s), erosion linearly decreases with depth (i.e. increasing induced flow velocity closer to deeper propellers). Furthermore,\na simplified assumption has been made whereby erosion increases as the probability of soft\nbottom substrate increases and erosion increases linearly to the annual vessel frequency\nwithin each corresponding cell.\nThe substrate and depth datasets used are also subject to limitations which should be\ninvestigated in further detail.",
    "recommendations_for_data_improvement": "The model could be further refined by adding addition criteria on vessel dimensions. Additional observational data could be collected to validate the model assumptions. The substrate dataset could be refined (for example consideration of the morphology of the substrate and compaction of sediments). Data on currents and exposure could be introduced (however it is assumed that the sediment data would be collinear). A more advanced form of modelling based (e.g. a GAM) might prove a different relationship between the different variables so this might be valuable to test.",

      "improvement_justification": "The layer has significant limitations, including a lack of model validation, simplified assumptions (e.g., all vessels have same characteristics, linear erosion with depth/frequency), and potential issues with underlying substrate and depth datasets. The recommendations suggest fundamental changes like adding vessel dimensions, collecting new observational data for validation, refining substrate data (morphology, compaction), introducing currents/exposure data, and exploring advanced modeling (e.g., GAM). These are not minor tweaks but require substantial methodological overhauls and new data integration, indicating a 'large' improvement potential.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements would be 'high' difficulty. It involves collecting new observational data for validation (which can be costly and time-consuming), refining complex substrate datasets (morphology, compaction), integrating dynamic environmental variables like currents and exposure, and potentially re-developing the core model using advanced statistical techniques (GAM). These tasks require significant resources, advanced technical expertise in marine geology, hydrodynamics, and statistical modeling, and extensive coordination.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can help improve this layer. While direct measurement of propeller-induced erosion is not possible, satellites can contribute to improving the input data and potentially validating aspects of the model. For instance, satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) could refine depth data in some areas, and satellite imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2 for turbidity/suspended sediment) could potentially provide observational data on areas of high turbidity, which might correlate with erosion, especially in shallow, coastal areas. This could aid in model validation or refinement of the erosion prediction. However, it's important to note that satellite data alone cannot fully replace in-situ measurements for model validation or detailed substrate characterization.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden, primarily offering Sentinel-2 data and national land cover, has limited direct applicability for improving this specific marine layer. While Sentinel-2 can detect suspended sediments in shallow, clear waters, its utility for validating propeller-induced erosion in deeper, potentially turbid shipping lanes is limited. The land cover data is not directly relevant. The core data needs (detailed bathymetry, substrate compaction, vessel-specific characteristics, in-situ current measurements) are beyond the scope of DigitalEarthSweden's current offerings. Therefore, it's 'false' that DigitalEarthSweden data can significantly help generate or improve this layer."

    "lineage": "With the assistance of a generalised spreading model (RL = SL – TL) the Received Level (RL) of sound was calculated for all cells in the SYMPHONY area at two frequencies (125 Hz and 2000 Hz). SL = Source level. Transmission loss (TL) was calculated as a function of the distance from the source (distance) as well as bottom substrate character at the source. For shallow (<30m) bottoms with hard sediment character the function 15 × log(distance) was used and for deep (>30m) bottom or soft sediment character the function 20 × log(distance) was used. Bottom substrate classification was based on maps of bottom substrate purpose produced by the Geological Survey of Sweden (SGU) for SYMPHONY. Bottom substrates where the proportion of soft bottom was > 50% were defined as having soft sediment character. The aggregated sound from all ships within a particular ship class over a year were combined and converted to sound intensity. The yearly average was calculated and then converted to sound volume expressed in average decibels (dBavg), which was calculated as follows: dBavg = 10 × log10(∑∆t/T×(10)^((RL intensity/10)) summed over all ∆t under the whole time period T (1 year alternatively 6 months). Source sound volumes that were applied for different ship classes were as follows: 125 Hz Passenger ships – 150 dB 125 Hz Cargo ships – 180 dB 125 Hz Tanker ships – 185 dB 2000 Hz Passenger ships – 150 dB 2000 Hz Cargo ships – 153 dB 2000 Hz Tanker ships – 160 dB Data were linear normalized between 100 and 150 dB yearly average.

Producing new data on 'seabed geomorphology' and 'sediment compaction' for the entire study area would require extensive, specialized marine surveys (e.g., high-resolution multibeam bathymetry, sub-bottom profiling, core sampling). Identifying and integrating 'additional sources of acoustic monitoring data' for validation would involve significant coordination, data harmonization, and potentially new in-situ deployments. The current model's generalized nature suggests that incorporating these detailed physical parameters would necessitate a more complex, physics-based sound propagation model, requiring advanced technical expertise and significant computational resources. This goes beyond simple updates or integration of existing datasets.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing cannot directly generate or significantly improve this layer. The core data needs are 'sediment compaction', 'seabed geomorphology' (beyond basic depth, requiring detailed morphology), and 'acoustic monitoring data' for validation. While satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) can provide some depth information in clear, shallow waters, it cannot provide sediment compaction or detailed geomorphology at the resolution and accuracy likely needed for sound propagation modeling. Acoustic monitoring data is inherently in-situ. Satellite observations are primarily for surface phenomena or broad-scale seafloor mapping, not sub-surface sediment properties or direct acoustic measurements.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden's primary offerings (Sentinel-2 Level-2A and national land cover data) are not suitable for generating or improving this layer. Sentinel-2 is an optical sensor primarily for land and very shallow, clear coastal waters. It cannot penetrate deep enough to map seabed geomorphology or sediment compaction in the offshore and deeper coastal waters relevant to shipping noise. It also cannot provide acoustic monitoring data. The national land cover data is terrestrial and not relevant to marine sound propagation modeling."

A cell value of 0 is equivalent to low exposure (<100 dB re 1 uPa) and a cell value of 100 is equivalent to high exposure (>150 dB re 1 uPa). Underlying data are from several sources and consist of shipping traffic data (AIS 2015), bottom substrate data, and depth data that have been combined and modelled. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation\nof policy at plan area scales.

    "lineage": "Lineage: With the assistance of a generalised spreading model (RL = SL – TL) the Received Level (RL) of sound was calculated for all cells in the SYMPHONY area at two frequencies (125 Hz and 2000 Hz). SL = Source level. Transmission loss (TL) was calculated as a function of the distance from the source (distance) as well as bottom substrate character at the source. For shallow (<30m) bottoms with hard sediment character the function 15 × log(distance) was used and for deep (>30m) bottom or soft sediment character the function 20 × log(distance) was used. Bottom substrate classification was based on maps of bottom substrate purpose produced by the Geological Survey of Sweden (SGU) for SYMPHONY. Bottom substrates where the proportion of soft bottom was > 50% were defined as having soft sediment character. The aggregated sound from all ships within a particular ship class over a year were combined and converted to sound intensity. The yearly average was calculated and then converted to sound volume expressed in average decibels (dBavg), which was calculated as follows: dBavg = 10 × log10(∑∆t/T×(10)^((RL intensity/10)) summed over all ∆t under the whole time period T (1 year alternatively 6 months). Source sound volumes that were applied for different ship classes were as follows: 125 Hz Passenger ships – 150 dB 125 Hz Cargo ships – 180 dB\n125 Hz Tanker ships – 185 dB\n2000 Hz Passenger ships – 150 dB\n2000 Hz Cargo ships – 153 dB\n2000 Hz Tanker ships – 160 dB\nData were linear normalized between 100 and 150 dB yearly\naverage. Schematic source strengths for different ship types\nand frequency ranges have been determined by a literature\nstudy. In cases where source strengths of 1/3 octave band at\n125 and 2000 Hz have not been identified, the closest value\nfound in the literature is used.\nMore detailed information on the lineage and methodology\nis available and can be supplied on request to the data\nowner.",
    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "The generalized sound propagation model is not externally validated so the results of the modelling should be interpreted with caution. Attention should be paid to the underlying quality and accuracy of the sediment substrate data. In particular the Geological Survey of Sweden (SGU) provided data on the probability of occurrence of soft sediment substrates for these modelling, these data are based on both on dominant grain size and categorical maps based on hydroacoustic data. The model does not include information on sediment compaction and morphology which will certainly affect sound propagation. This model should therefore be used with caution and should not be used for detailed studies of smaller areas.",

The recommendations suggest producing data on seabed geomorphology (e.g., depth metrics) and sediment compaction, and identifying additional sources of acoustic monitoring data for validation.

Furthermore, identifying and integrating 'additional sources of acoustic monitoring data' for model validation implies a significant effort in data acquisition, standardization, and integration. The current model's lack of external validation and its sensitivity to unmodeled factors (sediment compaction/morphology) suggest that addressing these issues would require advanced technical expertise, extensive coordination, and substantial resources, making it 'high' difficulty.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can contribute to improving this layer, particularly regarding seabed geomorphology and potentially validating aspects of the model. Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) can provide depth metrics, especially in shallower coastal areas, which is a recommended improvement. While satellites cannot directly measure sound propagation or sediment compaction, they can provide valuable input data (like bathymetry) that influences sound propagation models. Additionally, satellite imagery could potentially assist in mapping broad sediment types in very shallow, clear waters, though this is less direct for the specific needs of compaction and morphology.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden, primarily offering Sentinel-2 Level-2A data and national land cover, has limited direct applicability for improving this specific marine noise layer. While Sentinel-2 can provide some information on coastal land use and very shallow water features, it lacks the specialized sensors for deep-water bathymetry, sediment compaction, or direct acoustic monitoring. The core needs for this layer are detailed seabed characteristics (geomorphology, compaction) and acoustic validation data, which are beyond the capabilities of the current DigitalEarthSweden offerings. Its focus is more on terrestrial and coastal land cover/change detection rather than detailed marine physical parameters relevant to sound propagation."

    "summary": "The raster layer intends to show the probability of exposure to an oil spill from shipping over the course of a year in Swedish coastal and offshore waters under meteorological\nconditions equivalent to a drift speed of 0.2 knots. A cell\nvalue of 0 is equivalent to low probability of exposure and a\ncell value of 100 is equivalent to a high probability of\nexposure. Underlying data are from two sources and consist\nof shipping traffic data (AIS 2015) and illegal oil discharge\ndata (HELCOM, 2015) that have been combined and\nmodelled. These data were created as a data input layer for\n'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at\nthe Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management\n(SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the\ncumulative environmental impact of human activity in\nSwedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at\nplan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is\nonly advisable with the guidance and advice of the data\nsources.",
    "summary_swedish": "Detta rasterskikt avser att visa sannolikheten att drabbas av oljespill från fartyg under ett år, under meteorlogiska förhållanden som motsvarar en drifthastighet av 0,2 knop. Ett cellvärde av 0 motsvarar låg sannolikhet för oljespill, och ett cellvärde av 100 motsvarar hög sannolikhet. Underlagsdata härrör från två källor och består av trafikdata (AIS, 2015) och data över illegala oljeutsläpp (HELCOM, 2015) som har kombinerats och modellerats. Denna data skapades som ett data input layer för ’Symphony’ verktyget utvecklat av enheten för havsplaneringen på Havs- och vattenmyndigheten (HaV). Symphony används av HaV för bedömning av den kumulativa miljöpåverkan av mänsklig aktivitet i svenska vatten och används vid havsplanering. Återanvändning av denna data för andra ändamål är endast lämpligt efter vägledning och rådgivning av datakällorna.",
    "lineage": "Based on data of ship traffic (AIS 2015) and detected oil spills (HELCOM, 2015, http://helcom.fi/baltic-sea- trends/data-maps/) the likelihood that an oil spill would occur in an area with a certain level of ship traffic intensity was established. The likelihood of an oil spill was calculated for 10 classes of ship traffic intensity. A focal statistics filter was applied on the generated raster to simulate areas that could be impacted by a spill. The impact area was estimated for an oil spill with a residence time of 24 h and a spreading distance equivalent to the distance that a spill can travel with a speed of 0.2 or 0.5 knots (i.e. two spreading scenarios with wind speeds of approx. 4.5 m/s and 8.5 m/s, in accordance with the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute’s (SMHI) report 2007-8, Fairways in the Baltic Sea, Oil spill risk assessment). A sensitivity analysis was undertaken whereby detected spills moved a distance equivalent to that of the drift speed under 12h in a random direction. The sensitivity analysis indicated high sensitivity for the spills reported location. To simulate the oil spill weathering (i.e.\ndissolution, dilution, dispersion, sedimentation and\nevaporation) a linear decrease with respect to increasing\ndistance from the source cell was applied. Discussion on the\nmethod occurred between WSP (consultant) and SwAM\n(client) as well as Linnaeus University (expert).",
    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "The model used requires a connection between vessel intensity and likelihood of an oil spill but there are a number of other explanatory factors with great or greater relevance with are currently omitted. The sensitivity analysis indicated high sensitivity to the spill's reported location. The spill may have moved in the period between occurrence of the spill to the Coast Guard's discovery which introduces major uncertainties in the model. Data on seabirds killed by oil spills indicates that the actual amount of spills that are happening are likely to be greater than reported. This gives further uncertainty and implies that the model probably underestimates the likelihood. The probability that a spill enters the surrounding grid cell has been calculated by assuming a linear decrease with probability 0 at the distance reached during 24 h with a wind speed of 0.2 knots. The results should be interpreted as standard estimates.",
    "recommendations_for_data_improvement": "There are insufficient data on actual spill occurrences so the model results should be interpreted with caution. These model could be significantly improved with higher rates of detection. It is unclear if reporting to the maritime authority is based on real time satellite data. Surface Aperture Radar (SAR) equipped satellite sensors are becoming increasingly capable of detecting spills. Further investigations should be undertaken to identify potential data gathering opportunities.",

      "improvement_justification": "The layer explicitly states 'insufficient data on actual spill occurrences' and that the model 'probably underestimates the likelihood' due to underreporting. It also notes 'major uncertainties' due to sensitivity to reported spill location and movement. Addressing these fundamental data gaps and model uncertainties requires a 'major improvement' involving new data collection (better detection) and potentially a 'fundamental methodological overhaul' to account for actual spill frequency and location accuracy.",
      "difficulty_justification": "The recommendations suggest 'higher rates of detection' and 'further investigations...to identify potential data gathering opportunities', implying a need for new data collection protocols or integration of advanced detection technologies (like SAR satellites). This is a 'major infrastructure' and 'advanced technical expertise' undertaking, especially if it involves real-time satellite data integration and validation, making it 'high' difficulty.",
      "satellite_justification": "The recommendations explicitly mention 'Surface Aperture Radar (SAR) equipped satellite sensors are becoming increasingly capable of detecting spills' and question if reporting is 'based on real time satellite data'. This directly indicates that satellite remote sensing, particularly SAR, can significantly help in generating or improving this layer by providing more accurate and comprehensive data on actual spill occurrences, addressing the core limitation of 'insufficient data'.",
      "digital_earth_sweden_justification": "DigitalEarthSweden primarily offers Sentinel-2 optical data and national land cover data. While Sentinel-2 can detect large, visible oil spills in clear waters, its primary utility is for land and shallow water applications. It lacks the all-weather, day/night capabilities of SAR for oil spill detection, which is specifically highlighted as a key improvement area. Therefore, DigitalEarthSweden's current offerings are not directly suitable for generating or significantly improving the core 'oil spill detection' aspect of this marine layer."
