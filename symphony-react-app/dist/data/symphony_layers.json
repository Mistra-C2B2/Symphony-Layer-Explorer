    "summary": "This raster data intends to show bird density in coastal areas around the Swedish coast. The source data is voluntary observational statistics exported to an excel file from SLU Artdatabanken (species database) via Analysisportal.se and these data have been converted to density data (average numbers of individual birds reported between May and June within 5km of each grid cell over the period 2010-2017). These data are based on voluntary reporting and are therefore subject to observer bias. Areas without sightings are not reported and areas where many reports are made may be visited by multiple observers. As a consequence these data should be treated cautiously. A cell value of zero represents no reported observation of birds a cell value of 100 represents the maximum observed species diversity at the Beijershamn nature reserve in Öland. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only\nadvisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",

Denna data är baserat på frivillig rapportering och kan därför variera i kontinuitet. Områden utan observationer rapporteras inte och områden där många rapporter gjorts kan ha besökt av flera observatörer. Följaktligen bör dessa data behandlas med försiktighet. Ett cellvärde av 0 motsvarar inga rapporterade fågelobservationer, ett cellvärde av 100 motsvarar den maximala observerade fågeltätheten vid Beijershamns naturreservat på Öland.

      "improvement_justification": "The layer explicitly states significant limitations due to voluntary reporting and observer bias, leading to potential misrepresentation of bird density (e.g., higher density near urban centers or well-known birdwatching areas, and zero values where no observations occurred). The recommendation to 'correct observer bias if such data exist (i.e., map survey intensity and divide observation reports by the number of observations)' suggests a fundamental methodological change is needed to improve data accuracy and reliability. This goes beyond minor refinements and aims to address a core bias in the data, indicating a large potential for improvement.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvement of correcting observer bias by mapping survey intensity and dividing observation reports would require 'determining if null data are recorded' and 'if observation density data are available'. This implies a need to access and process additional, potentially complex, metadata from the source (SLU Artdatabanken/Analysisportal.se) that is not currently integrated. While not requiring new primary data collection in the field, it involves advanced data analysis, potentially complex statistical modeling to derive survey intensity, and significant data integration efforts. This level of data manipulation and methodological refinement falls into the 'medium' difficulty category.",
      "satellite_justification": "The 'Coastal birds' layer is based on direct observations of bird species and their numbers. Satellite remote sensing cannot directly observe individual birds or bird species diversity/density. While satellites can provide environmental context (e.g., habitat mapping, water quality, chlorophyll-a which might indicate food sources), they cannot replace or directly enhance the core data of bird presence and abundance. The limitations and recommendations specifically point to issues with human observation bias and reporting, which are not addressable by satellite data. Therefore, satellite remote sensing is not applicable for generating or improving this specific layer's core content."

These were used to calculate proportional population densities for defined inventory sectoral areas. For each species the observed abundance was divided by the survey area sector to produce areal abundance data. This areal abundance layer was then divided by the species' total population to give a proportional value relative to the species as a whole. The total populations used were: Common Eider: 515 000, Common Scoter: 412 000, Long-Tailed Duck: 1 482 000, Velvet Scoter: 373 000. Finally, data for each of the five species were aggregated into a single layer where the highest proportional value from any of these species was attributed to each sector. In order to capture the full spatial range of the seabirds including areas of peripheral importance this aggregated species density dataset was normalised using a transformation (lin100LogxLin01) and rescaled between 0 and 100 in ArcGIS. Consultation on the methodology has taken place between WSP, Lund University and the Swedish Agency for Water and Marine Management.",

This approach might reduce some of the observer bias (by increasing the influence of unsurveyed areas) in the interpolation model but the result\nshould be considered to be a conservative estimate of species density.",

This would involve identifying relevant environmental parameters (e.g., bathymetry, sea surface temperature, salinity, prey availability, current patterns), acquiring these data, developing and validating complex species distribution models (e.g., GLMs, GAMs, machine learning), and potentially new field surveys to validate these models. This is a substantial undertaking requiring advanced technical expertise and potentially new data collection.",

While satellite remote sensing can provide environmental preference data (e.g., sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a as proxies for prey, bathymetry), it cannot directly observe or count seabirds at the species level with the resolution and accuracy required for population density estimation. The primary limitation is the reliance on direct observation of birds, which satellites cannot provide. Therefore, satellite data can contribute to the 'environmental preference data' for advanced modeling but cannot generate or directly improve the fundamental bird density observations themselves."

This raster is a spatial model which shows aggregated species density (relative to the total species population size) of Velvet Scoter, Long tailed duck, Common Scoter and Common Eider. It is based on modelled population densities which were produced using environmental data to infer species distributions in unsurveyed areas. These models were based on field surveys undertaken in the Baltic Sea between 2007 and 2009. The highest occurring value between the species has been attributed to each individual cell and a linear transformation was applied so that a cell value of 0 is equivalent to zero abundance (or no data) and a cell value of 100 is equivalent to the maximum [relative] density for any one of these five species. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",

    "lineage": "Data for the Baltic Sea on four species of wintering seabirds (Velvet Scoter, Long tailed duck, Common Scoter, Common Eider) were sourced in the form of modelled raster data from the SOWBAS database (Status of wintering Waterbird populations in the Baltic Sea) as detailed in the report: Waterbird Populations and Pressures in the Baltic Sea, Nordic Council of Ministers, Copenhagen, TemaNord 2011:550 ISBN 978-92-893-2249-2). The source data are from aerial, shore and ship based surveys undertaken between 2007 and 2009 and these data were modelled (using a two step General Additive Model) to predict the species distribution both inside and outside surveyed areas based on environmental predictor variables. The modelled area is limited to the Baltic Sea. The modelled densities are expressed in number / km2 and these data were normalized against the species total population to give the value per cell relative to the species population as a whole. The total populations used were: Common Eider: 515 000, Common Scoter: 412 000, Long- Tailed Duck: 1 482 000, Velvet Scoter: 373 000. Finally, the relative occurrence of the four species was aggregated where the value of the species with the highest relative occurrence was attributed to each cell. In order to capture the full spatial range of the seabirds including areas of peripheral importance this aggregated species density dataset was normalised using a transformation (lin100LogxLin01) and rescaled between 0 and 100 in ArcGIS. Consultation on the methodology has been carried out\nbetween the WSP and the Swedish Agency for Water and\nMarine Management.",

This suggests a need for new data collection and potentially re-modeling, which represents a substantial improvement rather than just minor refinements.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Updating the product with 'more new input data' for four seabird species across the Baltic Sea implies substantial new field surveys (aerial, shore, ship-based), which are resource-intensive. While not 'high' (which might imply major infrastructure changes), it certainly requires advanced technical expertise for modeling and significant data collection, placing it in the 'medium' difficulty category.",
      "satellite_justification": "The layer is based on modelled population densities of seabirds derived from field surveys (aerial, shore, ship-based). While environmental data (e.g., sea surface temperature, bathymetry) were used as predictors in the original model, the core data for seabird presence/abundance comes from direct observation. Satellite remote sensing cannot directly observe or count seabirds or their specific species distributions at the resolution and detail required for this layer. While satellite data could potentially provide updated environmental predictor variables, it cannot replace the fundamental biological survey data needed to update the seabird distribution models themselves."

    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "This dataset is created from models based on water column source data from two different time periods (1993-2014 and 1960-2014) and historical sediment data (1950-2014). There is significant temporal variability (both annual and decadal) in oxygen conditions which are not represented in this data product. We combine all the available data with the intention of showing maximum spatial extent of annual average sediment anoxia over the range of all input data (1950-2014). The modelled data from SMHI lack spatial resolution inshore so depth is used as a proxy based on a observed trend of increasing sediment anoxia with depth in SGU's sediment records. Anoxia is also assumed to increase in areas with complex shorelines (due to decreased currents) but there is no data available to confirm this trend.",
    "recommendations_for_data_improvement": "At present there is insufficient data with the descriptive resolution and spatial precision to produce an reliable (i.e. empirically validated) model of current (or even decadal annual average) sediment anoxia conditions. SGU now have an oxygen sensor attached to their camera system which is used to sample water column anoxia. We recommend collection of field sample data detailing oxygen content of the sediment samples along with nutrient and geophysical and geochemical conditions which could lead to a better understanding of the spatial dynamics and therefore enable the production of a spatial models which can use proxies (depth, sediment composition and water column data) to predict benthic conditions and which can be used for model validation. Autonomous field sampling (i.e. data nodes and landers) is a potential solution to better data as technology improves. https://viewintotheblue.com/underwater-science-nodes",

The recommendations call for fundamental changes, including collection of field sample data detailing oxygen content of sediment samples, nutrient, geophysical, and geochemical conditions, and autonomous field sampling.

      "satellite_justification": "The core data needed for improvement, as per the recommendations, is 'oxygen content of the sediment samples along with nutrient and geophysical and geochemical conditions' of the benthic substrate. Satellite remote sensing primarily observes surface or near-surface water properties (e.g., sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a, suspended sediments, water quality indicators) or land features. It cannot directly measure benthic oxygen levels, sediment composition, or nutrient concentrations within the sediment. While satellite-derived bathymetry is mentioned as a potential capability, the layer already uses 'open depth data' and identifies the need for direct benthic measurements, which satellites cannot provide. Therefore, satellite data cannot effectively replace or directly supplement the critical in-situ benthic measurements required for validation and improvement."

Underlying data are from three sources and consist of modelled data, catch per unit effort data, and catch data (landings) all covering the period 2010-2015. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",

Sum catch data from commercial fishing and survey data from the West coast within their respective ICES rectangles. 2. Sum Cod models for large and small cod to encompass all cod sizes. 3.

      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing 'Predictive modelling of cod using relevant environmental variables' for the entire area would involve significant challenges. It requires advanced technical expertise in ecological modeling, access to and integration of various environmental datasets (which may not be readily available or harmonized), and potentially extensive data collection for model calibration and validation. The current data sources are disparate (modelled, CPUE, landings) and their combination is already complex. Developing a robust predictive model across diverse marine environments (Baltic, West Coast, Gulf of Bothnia) would be a 'high' difficulty undertaking, requiring substantial resources and expertise.",
      "satellite_justification": "The primary data for this layer are 'modelled data, catch per unit effort data, and catch data (landings)'. Cod distribution is fundamentally driven by biological factors (e.g., spawning grounds, food availability, predator-prey dynamics) and environmental factors (e.g., salinity, temperature, oxygen levels, depth). While satellite remote sensing can provide some environmental variables (e.g., Sea Surface Temperature, Chlorophyll-a as a proxy for primary productivity), it cannot directly measure cod abundance, catch per unit effort, or landings. The core limitation is the lack of fine-scale spatial variability in cod distribution, which is best addressed by in-situ biological sampling, acoustic surveys, or advanced ecological models incorporating a wider range of environmental and biological parameters, many of which are not directly observable from space. Therefore, satellite data cannot effectively replace or substantially improve the core data sources for cod abundance."

      "improvement_justification": "The layer explicitly states a significant limitation: 'uncertainty is considerably higher for each 250 m cell as the data provides no information on spatial variation within ICES rectangles.' The recommendation is 'Predictive modelling of herring using relevant environmental variables may be possible. If valid this approach would likely provide a dataset with a higher descriptive resolution.' This suggests a fundamental shift from aggregated ICES rectangle data to a higher-resolution predictive model, which constitutes a substantial improvement requiring new methodologies and potentially new data types (environmental variables).",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing 'predictive modelling of herring using relevant environmental variables' is a complex task. It would require identifying, acquiring, and processing relevant environmental variables (e.g., temperature, salinity, currents, prey distribution), developing and validating a robust ecological model, and potentially collecting new, higher-resolution in-situ data for model training and validation. This involves advanced technical expertise, potentially extensive new data collection, and significant computational resources, making it a high-difficulty endeavor.",
      "satellite_justification": "The primary data sources for this layer are acoustic density data and commercial catch data, which are in-situ measurements. While some environmental variables (e.g., sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a as a proxy for primary productivity) could potentially be derived from satellite remote sensing and used in a predictive model, the core 'herring distribution' itself (abundance, presence/absence) cannot be directly observed or effectively replaced by satellite observations. Herring are pelagic fish, and their distribution is primarily assessed through acoustic surveys and catch data. Satellite data would only provide ancillary environmental parameters, not the direct fish distribution data needed for the layer's core purpose."

      "satellite_justification": "The layer focuses on the presence and diversity of specific fish species within river mouths. While satellite remote sensing can provide valuable environmental parameters (e.g., water quality, temperature, turbidity) that influence fish habitats, it cannot directly detect or identify specific fish species or their presence/absence. The core data for this layer (fish presence) relies on in-situ biological sampling (electrofishing, direct observation) which cannot be replaced or directly supplemented by satellite observations. Therefore, satellite data cannot directly generate or significantly improve the fundamental biological data of fish presence/diversity for this layer."

    "summary": "The raster layer intends to show the predicted distribution of Sprat in Swedish marine waters. A cell value of 0 is equivalent to zero abundance and a cell value of 100 is equivalent to high relative abundance. Underlying data are from two sources and consist of acoustic density data (fish /area) and catch data (landings 2010-2015) from commercial fishing. The raster provides a good indication of fish distribution for each ICES rectangle however uncertainty is considerably higher for each 250 m cell as the data provides no information on spatial variation within ICES rectangles. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",

Ett cellvärde av 0 motsvarar ingen abundans, och ett cellvärde av 100 motsvarar hög relativ abundans. Underliggande data härrör från två källor och består av data från akustikstudier (fisk/område) och\nfångstdata (2010-2015) från kommersiellt fiske. Rastret ger\nen god indikation på fiskdistribution inom varje ICES-\nrektangel, men osäkerheten är avsevärt högre för varje 250\nm-cell eftersom denna data inte ger någon information om\nrumslig variation inom ICES-rektanglar. Denna data\nskapades som ett data input layer för ’Symphony’ verktyget\nutvecklat av enheten för havsplaneringen på Havs- och\nvattenmyndigheten (HaV). Symphony används av HaV för\nbedömning av den kumulativa miljöpåverkan av mänsklig\naktivitet i svenska vatten och används vid havsplanering.\nÅteranvändning av denna data för andra ändamål är endast\nlämpligt efter vägledning och rådgivning av datakällorna.",

      "improvement_justification": "The layer explicitly states a significant limitation: 'very little information about the spatial variability within these areas' (ICES rectangles). The recommendation of 'Predictive modelling of Sprat using relevant environmental variables' suggests a fundamental shift in methodology that could provide a 'higher descriptive resolution'. This indicates a large potential for improvement beyond minor refinements, moving towards a more spatially resolved and potentially more accurate distribution model.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing 'predictive modelling' with 'relevant environmental variables' would require advanced data analysis techniques (e.g., machine learning, statistical modeling), integration of new environmental datasets (which may need to be acquired or processed), and potentially validation efforts. While not requiring entirely new in-situ data collection for Sprat itself, the modeling aspect and integration of diverse environmental variables elevate the difficulty beyond 'low'. It's not 'high' as it doesn't necessarily require major infrastructure changes or extensive new biological sampling campaigns for Sprat distribution, but rather sophisticated data integration and modeling.",
      "satellite_justification": "The recommendation for 'predictive modelling of Sprat using relevant environmental variables' directly points to the utility of satellite remote sensing. Many environmental variables relevant to marine species distribution, such as sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a (as a proxy for primary productivity/food availability), and potentially even sea surface salinity (though less directly from current satellites for coastal areas), can be derived from satellite observations. These satellite-derived environmental parameters could serve as crucial input variables for the predictive models, thereby addressing the spatial resolution limitation of the original ICES rectangle data and improving the descriptive resolution of the Sprat distribution layer."

      "satellite_justification": "Vendace are a fish species, and their distribution is primarily influenced by factors like water temperature, salinity, depth, and prey availability. While satellite remote sensing can provide some environmental variables (e.g., sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a as a proxy for primary productivity/prey), it cannot directly measure Vendace abundance, nor can it provide crucial in-situ data like salinity at depth, specific prey species distribution, or detailed bathymetry at the resolution likely needed for fish habitat modeling. The underlying data are catch data, which are in-situ biological measurements. Therefore, satellite data cannot generate or fully replace the core biological data or many of the key environmental variables needed for a robust predictive model of a fish species."

    "summary": "The raster layer intends to show a general picture of important areas for commercial fish spawning in Swedish marine waters. A cell value of 0 is equivalent to no economic value for spawning and a cell value of 100 is equivalent to the highest economic value of spawning species. Underlying data are from two sources and consist of a depth model combined with the spawning area and spawning depth data of commercial fish species. This raster shows a measure of economic value by space based on the ratio between the economic value of each species and its calculated spawning area, summed for all species with an economic value> 100k per year for each marine plan area. The data were normalised on a linear scale for each plan area so a cell value of 100 on the West coast (North Sea) plan area equates to 25 species whereas on the East coast (Baltic) plan area it equates to 12 species and in the Northern plan area (Bottniskaviken) it equates to 5 species. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",

      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can contribute to improving this layer, particularly in the context of the recommended nursery grounds. Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) can refine depth models, which are crucial for both spawning and nursery areas. Coastal and habitat mapping from satellites can identify suitable substrate types (e.g., seagrass beds, rocky reefs) that serve as important nursery habitats. Ocean color data can provide insights into water quality parameters (e.g., turbidity, chlorophyll-a) that influence habitat suitability for both spawning and nursery grounds. While direct fish spawning or nursery activity cannot be observed, the environmental parameters and habitat characteristics derived from satellite data can significantly enhance the accuracy and spatial resolution of the underlying environmental layers used to define these areas."

    "summary": "This raster layer intends to show the predicted abrasion of benthic substrates as a consequence of bottom trawling in Swedish coastal and offshore waters. Underlying data are from two sources and consist of Surface Area Ratio (SAR) of trawling (OSPAR 2009-2013, and HELCOM 2009-2015) data. A cell value of 0 is equivalent to no benthic abrasion by bottom trawling and a cell value of 100 is equivalent to abrasion (SAR ≥ 8.196288). The surface area ratios (SAR) of trawling are produced by summing total swept area of trawling within a measurement area and then normalize the swept area to the measurement area. Assuming that within the measurement area the trawling is evenly distributed the surface area ratio is interpreted as the number of times per unit of time the measurement area is trawled over. The swept area for a specific fishing vessel is estimated using modelled trawl door spread (for a specific fishery/gear) multiplied by the vms (vessel monitoring system) speed and vms ping interval for a vms signal/position representing benthic trawling. The total swept area within a measurement area is then the sum of all swept area positions, from all vessels within a measurement area. For these data a logarithmic relationship between trawl intensity SAR and benthic impact due to abrasion is assumed, however habitat specific susceptibility to trawling is not modelled so this is a simplistic assumption. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales.

The method is described in the working group reports (ICES Working Group Spatial Fisheries Data report 2016), but in short the SAR of trawling are produced by summing total swept area of trawling within a measurement area and then normalize the swept area to the measurement area. Assuming that within the measurement area the trawling is evenly distributed the SAR is interpreted as the number of times per unit of time the measurement area is trawled over. The swept area for a specific fishing vessel is estimated using modelled trawl door spread (for a specific fishery/gear) multiplied by the vms speed and vms ping interval for a vms signal/position representing fishery. The total swept area within a measurement area is then the sum of all swept area\npositions, from all vessels within a measurement area.\nThe underlying data has been aggregated yearly on a\ngeographic grid of resolution 0.05 degree (approximately 1.5\nx 3 nm square at 57 N). Yearly data on total SAR are\nproduced in the HELCOM (the Baltic including Kattegat)\nand OSPAR (North East Atlantic incl. Kattegat) region\nrespectively. Data are available for the years 2009 – 2013 in\nthe HELCOM region and 2009-2015 in the OSPAR region.\nData are available as spatial polygons.\nEach year’s polygon dataset were projected into the\nSymphony projection ETRS1989 LAEA. Further the\npolygons were rasterized on the symphony grid using mean\nvalues if several polygons overlay the same raster grid cell.\nAverages of SAR values are calculated (introducing zero\nvalues in NA raster cells) over the time periods (2009-2015\nfor OSPAR and 2009-2013 for HELCOM) and the Kattegat\narea where masked from the HELCOM data set. Finally the\ntwo data sets were added and save as\n'Bottom_trawling_intensity_mean_SAR.tif'\nThe raster was normalized by dividing the data set by the\nmaximum SAR value in the Swedish exclusive economic\nzone (EEZ): maxEEZ SAR = 8.196288\nFrom this underlying data set, representing swept area of\nbottom trawlers, a logarithmic response proxy was derived\nrepresenting sedimentation impact from trawling and these\ndata were rescaled on a 0-1 scale.\nUncertainty of this layer is set to 0.5 representing a “good”\nmodel, in the whole region as the data are almost complete\ninternational data (representing vessels >12 m), they are\naverages over several years and thus represent a large part of\nthe total trawling effort and resource outtake but aggregated\ninto larger cells (0.05 degree resolution) and partly\nvalidated. Also compared to traditional proxies for bottom\ntrawling like kW*fishing hours, the SAR values takes into\naccount typical trawl widths for different fishing fleets.",
    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "This bottom impact layer aims to describe the impact of bottom trawling on benthic habitats. This bottom-trawling index is used as a proxy for this impact and a logarithmic relationship between trawl intensity and benthic impact is used. This a is simplified assumption - habitat specific susceptibility to trawling is not modelled.",
    "recommendations_for_data_improvement": "The source data for Symphony should continue to be based on international data. Work should continue to increase the availability of data volumes collected today by ICES within WGSFD. Current available data is not divided into pelagic / demersal species. Official landing statistics per ICES box could be used to weight trawl index for catches per box and,\nfor example, per demersal / pelagic target species.\nNew research (Benthis - 7th Framework Program and Trawling - Best Practice Project) is\ncurrently underway to develop indicators for use in, inter alia, the Marine Directive. These\nproposed indicators are based on a mechanistic link between trawl intensity and habitat\nspecific benthic responses. This are therefore different from previous expert-based\nsensitivity estimates and the benefits of these kind of data have been highlighted in ICES\nadvice. The indicator data being created in the Benthis project will have the advantage of\nbeing normalized to the interval [0.1] and will therefore be suitable for future Symphony\nupdates.\nWork is also ongoing to include not only the direct physical impact (abrasion/mechanical\ndamage) but also sedimentation. Future data products should, if possible, consist of the\ninternationally produced indicators. In order to improve these indicators, it is primarily\nknowledge about habitats and bottom type that should be improved - funding support for\nparticipation in any research and development projects that would help to continue this\ndevelopment are recommended.",

The recommendations highlight ongoing research (Benthis project) aiming to develop indicators based on a mechanistic link between trawl intensity and habitat-specific benthic responses, normalized to [0,1]. This represents a fundamental shift from the current simplistic logarithmic assumption and expert-based sensitivity estimates, moving towards a more ecologically sound and nuanced assessment of impact. Furthermore, the recommendation to include sedimentation impact and improve knowledge about habitats and bottom types points to a need for substantial new data and modeling approaches beyond just refining existing methods.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements, particularly incorporating habitat-specific susceptibility and mechanistic links, requires significant research and development (as evidenced by the Benthis project). It involves advanced modeling, extensive new data collection (e.g., detailed habitat mapping, benthic response data), and potentially new methodologies for integrating these complex factors. The recommendation for funding support for participation in R&D projects underscores the resource-intensive nature. Improving knowledge about habitats and bottom types is a substantial undertaking, often requiring extensive in-situ surveys and advanced mapping techniques. The shift from a simplified logarithmic model to a mechanistic, habitat-specific one represents a major methodological overhaul.",
      "satellite_justification": "The core data for this layer is derived from Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) data, which tracks fishing vessel movements, and modeled trawl door spread. The impact assessment relies on swept area ratios and a proxy for benthic abrasion/sedimentation. While satellite remote sensing can provide valuable information on sea surface temperature, currents, and potentially some aspects of water quality (e.g., suspended sediments from large-scale dredging, though not directly from individual trawl events), it cannot directly measure or infer the physical abrasion of the seabed by trawl gear, the specific benthic habitats present at depth, or their susceptibility to trawling. Habitat mapping at the resolution and depth required for benthic impact assessment typically relies on acoustic surveys (multibeam, side-scan sonar) and in-situ sampling (grabs, cores, video). Therefore, satellite data cannot effectively replace or significantly enhance the primary data sources or the core impact assessment methodology for bottom trawling abrasion."

This raster is modelled using morphology metrics calculated from depth data provided by the Swedish Maritime Administration and expert judgement based on comparison with geological surveys undertaken by the Swedish Geological Survey (in areas surveyed by both agencies). A cell value of 0 is equivilent to zero probability of the prescence of hard bottom and a cell value of 100 is equivilent to a high probability of presence. Underlying data are from 'best available' historical data with variable quality: refer to the associated uncertainty layer for for information on data quality. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",

    "lineage": "This dataset was created by combining a range of seabed complexity metrics which were calculated in ArcGIS (with the spatial analyst extension) on a 10m resolution depth model maintained by the Swedish Maritime Agency (SMA). The indata to this analysis are from a 'best available' 10m resolution depth grid known as DIS (depth information system). Although the data are gridded to 10m the it is important to be aware that the input data are of highly varying quality. Refer to the associated map of spatial uncertainty for this layer to understand where major data gaps exist. DIS contains data which can be categorised into three quality classes. The highest quality data are collected using from modern techniques (for example multibeam echosounder surveys) and provide full coverage depth data (this is mostly restricted to shipping lanes), these data are charted to international standards (IHO S-44). The second category of data are those collected using modern techniques but which do not comply with international charting standards (although are still very high resolution for our intended use), they are data collected after 1987 (and therefore have a good positional accuracy) but they may not provide 100% coverage of the seafloor. The final, lower quality class of data are those collected before 1987 from historical chart archives based on data collected using older methods (e.g. single beam echosounders or lead-line surveys). In all classes of data it should be noted that depths may also be subject to a shoal-bias (reduced depths) which is standard practice for reducing potential collision risk in navigational charting. Due to mixing data resolutions data artefacts are likely to be present in the grid at boundaries between high resolution and low resolution surveys. The procedure used to produce the complexity datasets for Symphony were as follows: A) 6 complexity metrics and a hillshade were calculated:\n1. Bathymetric Positioning Index (BPI) with an inner\ndiameter of 10m & outer diameter of 250m,\n2. Bathymetric Positioning Index with ID:10m & OD:50m:\nhttps://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/tools/btm.html\n3. Slope using a 10m grid with ArcGIS spatial analyst.\n4. Slope using a 250m grid (downsampled from the 10m\ngrid) with ArcGIS spatial analyst.\n5. Standard deviation of depth using a neighborhood size of\n5 cells (50m) and the 10m grid with ArcGIS spatial analyst.\n6. Standard deviation of depth using a neighborhood size of\n25cell (250m) and the 10m grid with ArcGIS spatial analyst.\n7. A hillshade layer for visual interpretation\nData were generated using a ArcGIS modelbuilder toolbox\ndeveloped by SGU, and executed by SMA.\nB) All 6 complexity metrics where resampled to a 50m raster\n(mean value) using ArcGIS\nC) BPI metrics (1. and 2.) were stretched using an e log (base\n2,718) function and rescaled between 0 and 10.\nD) Slope and standard deviation metrics were also stretched\nusing an e log function and rescaled between 0 and 10.\nE) A average (MEAN) raster was calcultated by combining\nall the stretched and rescaled metrics from (C & D) .\nF) Raster values between 2.5 and 7.5 in the raster (E) were\nrescaled between 0 and 10 normalising the data to reflect\nhardbottom features.\nG) The resulting dataset was then downsampled from 50m\nto 300m using the maximum value in a 6x6 cell\nneighbourhood.\nH) The result (G) was standardised to the Symphony grid\n250m (nearest neighbour) with no-data set to zero.\nI) The result (H) was normalised by substrating the\nSymphony hardbottom dataset and the result rescaled\nbetween 0 and 100.\nJ) The result (I) was split into 3 depth zones photic, and\naphotic below & aphotic above 60m",
    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "There are some key limitations to be aware of when using these data: 1) Although this data product is based on the best available depth data - these depth data are of variable quality. In some areas there are even no data available: for example the area around Bratten Bohuslän coast. For further information on depth data uncertainty refer to\nthe confidence map associated with this dataset.\n2) The model is based on data with a minimum mapping unit of 50m. This is not detailed\nenough to pick out smaller depth / morphology variations and a consequence the dataset\nmay not help in the identification of certain geological features (e.g. sparse boulders on a flat\nlandscape) which may be important or sensitive habitat.\n3) This dataset is intended to be used as a proxy for hard bottom bethic habitat (i.e.\nidentifying areas where SGUs geological survey data are unavailable) however this refers to\nmorphological complexity (and light penetration) and does not consider geological\nsubstrate. Therefore areas which are 'complex' in terms of morphology may not always be\nhard bottom.\n4) Normalisation to reflect 'hard bottom' features was undertaken by visual comparison with\nSymphony 'hard bottom' data - i.e. derived from SGUs geological maps. However, a perfect\nmatch between complexity and hardbottom is not possible using expert judgement.\n5) These data are currently only available for Sweden.",
    "recommendations_for_data_improvement": "Further data collection is requied in areas with no data or low quality data. Rather than using two separate habitat proxy datasets in Symphony - morphological complexity (modelled from depth) and hardbottom (modelled from geological maps) the data on complexity should instead be used to drive a predictive model of substrate in combination with other physical predictor variables (such as currents & wave exposure) and ground validation data from point obserations. This work is in progress at SGU. This approach demonstrates a great deal of potential for improvement of national geological datasets. It is therefore reccomended that the approach is extended to surrounding countries (perhaps via international collaboration projects like Emodnet).",

This represents a significant methodological overhaul and integration of new data types (currents, wave exposure, point observations), indicating a large potential for improvement beyond mere refinement.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended predictive model requires advanced modeling techniques, integration of diverse physical predictor variables (currents, wave exposure), and extensive new ground validation data collection. The recommendation for extending this approach to surrounding countries via international collaboration further highlights the high level of resources, technical expertise, and coordination required.",
      "satellite_justification": "While the primary data for this layer (depth) is not directly from satellite, satellite remote sensing can contribute significantly to the recommended improvements. Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) could help fill data gaps in shallow, clear waters, especially in areas with 'no data available' as mentioned in the limitations. Furthermore, satellite data can provide valuable input for 'other physical predictor variables' for the proposed predictive model, such as wave exposure (derived from satellite altimetry or SAR data) and potentially surface currents (though less directly for benthic substrate). Coastal habitat mapping from satellite imagery could also aid in validating or refining the model's outputs in shallow areas."

The indata to this analysis are from a 'best available' 10m resolution depth grid known as DIS (depth information system). Although the data are gridded to 10m the it is important to be aware that the input data are of highly varying quality. Refer to the associated map of spatial uncertainty for this layer to understand where major data gaps exist. DIS contains data which can be categorised into three quality classes. The highest quality data are collected using from modern techniques (for example multibeam echosounder surveys) and provide full coverage depth data (this is mostly restricted to shipping lanes), these data are charted to international standards (IHO S-44). The second category of data are those collected using modern techniques but which do not comply with international charting standards (although are still very high resolution for our\nintended use), they are data collected after 1987 (and\ntherefore have a good positional accuracy) but they may not\nprovide 100% coverage of the seafloor.

For further information on depth data uncertainty refer to the confidence map associated with this dataset. 2) The model is based on data with a minimum mapping unit of 50m.

Therefore areas which are 'complex' in terms of morphology may not always be hard bottom. 4) Normalisation to reflect 'hard bottom' features was undertaken by visual comparison with Symphony 'hard bottom' data - i.e. derived from SGUs geological maps.

This work is in progress at SGU. This approach demonstrates a great deal of potential for improvement of national geological datasets.

      "improvement_justification": "The recommendations explicitly suggest a fundamental shift from using morphological complexity as a proxy to developing a predictive model of substrate, combining multiple physical predictor variables (currents, wave exposure) with ground validation data. This represents a significant methodological change and requires new data collection (ground validation) and advanced modeling, indicating a large potential for substantial improvement over the current proxy-based approach. The current limitations highlight issues with variable data quality, minimum mapping unit, and the proxy not always reflecting true hard bottom, all of which could be significantly addressed by the recommended predictive modeling approach.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended predictive model involves advanced technical expertise (combining multiple physical variables, developing predictive models), substantial new data collection (ground validation from point observations), and likely collaboration across multiple organizations (SGU, SwAM, potentially international partners like Emodnet for extension to other countries). This level of effort, resource allocation, and coordination places the difficulty at a high level.",
      "satellite_justification": "While the primary data for this layer (depth) is not directly from satellite, satellite remote sensing can contribute to the recommended improvements. Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) could potentially help fill data gaps in shallower, clearer waters, especially in areas with 'no data available' as mentioned in the limitations (e.g., Bratten Bohuslän coast), although its utility in deep aphotic waters is limited. More importantly, satellite data can provide crucial predictor variables for the recommended predictive model of substrate. For instance, satellite observations can contribute to understanding wave exposure (e.g., from wave height data) and potentially inferring current patterns (e.g., from sea surface temperature gradients or altimetry-derived geostrophic currents, though less directly for benthic currents). While not directly mapping hard bottom, these satellite-derived environmental parameters can serve as valuable inputs to a predictive model, enhancing its accuracy and spatial coverage, especially when combined with in-situ ground validation data."

      "improvement_justification": "The recommendations explicitly suggest a fundamental shift from using morphological complexity as a proxy to developing a predictive model of substrate, combining multiple physical predictor variables and ground validation. This represents a significant methodological change and requires extensive new data collection (ground validation) and advanced modeling, indicating a large potential for substantial improvement over the current proxy-based approach. The current limitations highlight issues with data quality, resolution, and the inherent difficulty in equating morphology with geological substrate, all of which a predictive model aims to address.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended predictive model involves 'work in progress at SGU' and 'extension to surrounding countries (perhaps via international collaboration projects like Emodnet)'. This implies advanced technical expertise (predictive modeling, integration of diverse physical variables), extensive new data collection (ground validation, potentially across borders), and significant collaboration across multiple organizations (national agencies, international projects). The need for 'further data collection in areas with no data or low quality data' also points to substantial resource requirements.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can contribute to improving this layer, particularly in generating or enhancing some of the 'other physical predictor variables' for the recommended predictive model. While direct 'hard bottom' mapping is challenging for satellite, satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) could potentially fill some 'no data' or 'low quality data' gaps in the depth data, especially in shallower, clearer waters, which is relevant for a 'photic' layer. Additionally, satellite data on wave exposure (derived from wave height/sea state) or current patterns (though more complex) could potentially be integrated into a predictive substrate model. However, it cannot replace the need for in-situ geological surveys or high-resolution acoustic data for ground validation and detailed substrate mapping."

This raster is represented with the value 100 where lophelia spp. and / or poriforia spp. communities are predicted to be present and value 0 where there is no information available. It is based on field survey point observation data stored in Gothenburg University's Koster database and the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute's SHARK (\"Svenskt HavsARKiv\") database. No prediction is made of where these communities might exist in unsurveyed areas. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs marine spatial planning at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes and particularly for local decision support is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data source.",

    "lineage": "The observational data used to create this dataset is from Gothenburg University's 'Koster' database, SMHI's 'SHARK' database, \"Tomas Lundälv, 2014, Kartläggning yttre havler nordöstra skagerrak\" and from internal data held by Aquabiota AB. Various tools and internal developed models were used in ArcMap 10.3 to produce the final data such as Dissolve, Point to Raster, Polygon to Raster, Raster calculator and Water Ways model 1.02 (Aquabiota AB model). The method is a simple GIS-model that aims to extrapolate lophelia and porifera distributions based on presence point density and distance between point through water ways. This model does not take into account any environmental variables The model groups presence samples if they are within 1500 m distance through water ways and therefore the entire buffered grouped area becomes an expected distribution area. Expected distribution area is represented with value 100 in raster file. Another condition is needed to be fulfilled to form an expected lophelia distribution area which is the samples density need to be three or more than three samples and they need to be at least 125 m away from each other. The radius 1500 m is selected based on average sampling spatial distribution across the Swedish water body and therefore it is most likely to group samples in a more considerable way than other radius distances. The second condition distance is selected based on cell size distance which is 250 m. It is set 125 m with the reason of being half of the cell size distance and therefore aims to eliminate points that might be on the same raster cell that could lead to a false creation of expected bivalvia distribution area. The samples density three or more than three is selected based on average sampling spatial distribution within the area with the radius 1500 m. All sampling points that do not fulfil those two conditions are represented as only one cell with the value 100. More detailed information on the lineage and methodology is available and can be supplied on request to the data owner.",
    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "This dataset does not predict or model the possible presence of deep reef or sponge communities it relies on observational data. This data is therefore likely to an underestimate the presence of these habitats (perhaps significantly) because these habitats are hard to detect (they cannot be identified with acoustic data) and there is very little survey effort in deep water offshore areas.",
    "recommendations_for_data_improvement": "Based on available point data. Sampling efforts directed towards these species could improve the map, and possibly enable a more advanced modelling. If predictive modelling were to be attempted in future, better data on abiotic parameters (depth, water chemistry, currents and geology) data would be required to make reliable predictions - there are significant data gaps in the offshore environments on the West Coast of Sweden where these species are found. .",

The limitations state they 'cannot be identified with acoustic data' and require 'observational data'. The recommendations for improvement focus on 'sampling efforts' and 'abiotic parameters (depth, water chemistry, currents and geology)'. Satellite remote sensing cannot directly detect or map deep-water benthic communities or measure sub-surface water chemistry and currents at the required resolution and depth. While satellite-derived bathymetry exists, it's typically for shallower waters and less precise than acoustic methods for deep reefs. Therefore, satellite data cannot effectively generate or significantly improve this specific layer."

    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "There are a number of key limitations users should be aware of when using this dataset: 1) Only presence/absence data is available for sediment fractions in SGUs legacy sample inventory. Equal proportionality is assumed between the recorded sediment fractions but this may be invalid. 2) It was assumed that at least 20 replicates would be required to define the proportional makeup of each sediment class (in each sea area / depth / mapscale) . However, a power analysis was not undertaken to ensure sufficient sample availability for each surface substrate class and there is a significant range in replicate numbers between classes. 3) Where insufficient sample replication occurred to enable classification by depth, sea area and map scale data were averaged across depth ranges and between sea areas so certain classes are more reliable than others. 4) Surface substrates which form a veneer cover a smaller area of the seabed and consequently for some classes insufficient replicates were available for analysis. In this event the underlying sediment class was used for reclassification instead. In some classes on larger\nscale maps this might cause veneered sediments to be depicted as mixed proportions of the\nunderlying substrate & veneer sediment fractions.",

The core data for this layer (benthic substrate data, sediment fractions, and their proportionality) requires in-situ sampling, acoustic surveys, or direct observation, which cannot be effectively replaced or supplemented by current satellite capabilities for deep, aphotic benthic habitat mapping."

Underlying data consists of benthic substrate data (1975- 2015), depth data (2013, 2015), and photic zone data. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM).

    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "There are a number of key limitations users should be aware of when using this dataset: 1) Only presence/absence data is available for sediment fractions in SGUs legacy sample inventory. Equal proportionality is assumed between the recorded sediment fractions but this may be invalid. 2) It was assumed that at least 20 replicates would be required to define the proportional makeup of each sediment class (in each sea area / depth / mapscale) . However, a power analysis was not undertaken to ensure sufficient sample availability for each surface substrate class and there is a significant range in replicate numbers between classes. 3) Where insufficient sample replication occurred to enable classification by depth, sea area and map scale data were averaged across depth ranges and between sea areas so certain classes are more reliable than others. 4) Surface substrates which form a veneer cover a smaller area of the seabed and consequently for some classes insufficient replicates were available for analysis. In this event the underlying sediment class was used for reclassification instead. In some classes on larger scale maps this might cause veneered sediments to be depicted as mixed proportions of the underlying substrate & veneer sediment fractions.",

      "improvement_justification": "The limitations highlight fundamental issues with the underlying data and methodology, including reliance on presence/absence data, unvalidated proportionality assumptions, insufficient sample replication for classification, and reclassification using underlying sediment classes when veneer data is lacking. The recommendations suggest a sensitivity analysis for misclassification, validation with empirical data (particle size analysis), expert review, and gathering additional source data from surrounding countries for harmonization. Addressing these issues comprehensively would require significant re-evaluation of the data foundation and modeling approach, leading to a substantial improvement in the layer's reliability and accuracy, thus 'large' potential.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements would be challenging. Validating model predictions with empirical data like particle size analysis requires extensive new in-situ data collection, which is resource-intensive for deep aphotic zones. Undertaking a power analysis to ensure sufficient sample availability for each sediment class, as implied by the limitations, would necessitate significant new sampling efforts. Harmonizing data with surrounding countries implies complex data integration, standardization, and cross-border collaboration. These efforts involve substantial new data collection, advanced technical expertise for re-modeling, and significant coordination, making the difficulty 'high'.",
      "satellite_justification": "This layer focuses on 'hard bottom deep' substrates in aphotic zones deeper than 60m. Satellite remote sensing primarily operates by detecting reflected or emitted electromagnetic radiation from the Earth's surface or near-surface waters. While satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) can provide depth information in shallower, optically clear waters, it is generally not effective for depths beyond the photic zone (typically <30-40m, and certainly not 60m+ in turbid coastal waters). Substrate classification at these depths requires direct in-situ measurements (e.g., grab samples, ROV/AUV imagery, acoustic surveys like multibeam echosounder backscatter). Satellite data cannot directly 'see' or characterize the seafloor substrate at these depths, nor can it provide the detailed sediment fraction information or validate proportionality assumptions. Therefore, satellite remote sensing cannot directly generate, enhance, or validate this specific layer's core information."

The second is a simple spatial model of bivalve distribution based on observational data and proximity information. These two source datasets are binary data. They have been aggregated with a higher weight given to the bivalve dataset. A value of 0 in the combined dataset represents areas where no blue mussels are predicted and where no bivalve observations exist, a value of 100 represents areas where (or in close proximity to where) bivalves have been observed. A value of 30 represents areas where >10% cover of blue mussels are predicted (but where no observational data exists).

The first input layer for mytilus edulis was modelled using epibenthos data from SHARK (source: SMHI), where there are blue mussel observational records detailing % cover ranging from 0 to 100%. Data was divided into cover of <10% (0) and >=10% (1). This binary dataset was set to fit a presence-absence model (GAM, mgcv for R). This model used predictor variables including depth, sourced from biological records where available and completed with depth data from SwAM's Symphony depth dataset (source: Swedish Maritime Administration) where missing; Wave exposure: log(n+1)-transformed; bottom salinity (source: Emodnet Chemistry); benthic substrate from SwAM's\nSymphony geology data series: hardbotten_250m for the\neast coast and block_250m for the west coast (source:\nGeological Survey of Sweden). On the west coast a slope\nlayer calculated from the depth grid was also included in the\nmodel. The model was predicted using the same layers in\n250 m resolution. The cut-off in probability was set to 0.30\nfor the east coast and 0.10 for the west coast (the cut-off\nvalues are derived from the model and set to maximise the\nnumber of correctly classified presences and absences), so\nthat the cut-off value or higher is considered a presence and\nlower is considered an absence.\nThe second input layer showing sites with observations of\n'Bivalves' was created from ”Miljöövervakning av Knähaken\nmarina reservat 2011, Stina Bertilsson Vuksan och Peter\nGöransson, Miljöförvaltningen i Helsingborgs stad” and\nSHARKdata where the point data is represented as \"P\"\n(Presence). It includes all bivalves from the above sources\nsuch as Macoma balthica, Cerastoderma glaucum, Arctica\nislandica, Modiolus modiolus etc. Various tools and internal\ndeveloped models were used in ArcMap 10.3 to produce the\nfinal data such as Dissolve, Point to Raster, Polygon to\nRaster, Raster calculator and Water Ways model 1.02\n(Aquabiota AB's internally developed model).\nMore detailed information on the lineage and methodology\nis available and can be supplied on request to the data\nowner.",

      "improvement_justification": "The limitations explicitly state that 'model accuracy is limited by the resolution and quality of the environmental predictor variables. Salinity and temperature data are particularly lacking on the west coast.' and 'Coverage of sampling data is weak in some parts, especially on the west coast.' The recommendations suggest 'more accurate depth, salinity and temperature data' and 'more survey effort'. These point to fundamental data gaps and quality issues across key environmental parameters and observational data, requiring significant new data collection and potentially advanced modeling to achieve substantial improvement in the predictive model's accuracy and spatial coverage.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements would involve 'more survey effort' to collect 'more accurate depth, salinity and temperature data', especially in areas with weak sampling coverage like the west coast. This implies extensive in-situ data collection campaigns, which are resource-intensive, require specialized equipment and personnel, and involve significant logistical challenges. Improving the resolution and quality of environmental predictor variables, particularly salinity and temperature, often requires dedicated oceanographic surveys or the deployment of long-term monitoring infrastructure. This level of data acquisition and integration across a national scale represents a high degree of difficulty.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can significantly help improve this layer. While direct observation of mussel reefs requires in-situ methods, several key environmental predictor variables for the predictive model can be enhanced or supplemented by satellite data. Specifically, sea surface temperature (SST) can be derived from satellite observations at high resolution, addressing the stated lack of temperature data. Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) could potentially provide more accurate depth data in some coastal areas, especially where traditional survey data is sparse. Furthermore, satellite observations of ocean color can provide insights into water quality parameters (e.g., turbidity, suspended sediments) that might correlate with mussel habitat suitability, and could potentially be used to refine or validate aspects of the model. While salinity is challenging to measure directly from space at the required resolution for coastal areas, the ability to improve temperature and depth, and potentially other water quality parameters, makes satellite remote sensing a valuable tool for enhancing the predictive model's input data."

The 'Limitations' section explicitly states 'None', and 'Recommendations' states 'No current recommendations'. However, the 'Temporal Period' of 2014-2016 is quite dated for a dynamic parameter like plankton distribution, especially for policy formulation. Updating the temporal period to more recent data would significantly improve the layer's relevance and accuracy for current marine planning, moving beyond the 'None' limitation. Additionally, the normalization using a sigmoidal function to 'reduce the impact of extreme values' could be further investigated for its impact on representing actual high productivity areas, which might be crucial for certain ecological assessments. The 'Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources' also hints at potential limitations in broader applicability without expert consultation, suggesting room for improved transparency or broader validation. Therefore, there is a 'medium' potential for improvement by updating the temporal data and potentially refining the normalization process.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Updating the temporal period would involve re-processing more recent Copernicus marine chlorophyll-a data, which is a well-established process but requires computational resources and expertise in handling large satellite datasets. The lineage describes a multi-step process involving scripting (NCO in Linux), integration, averaging, and normalization. Replicating this for new data, while not fundamentally new methodology, requires significant data handling and processing. Refining the normalization function would require expert analysis and potentially re-tuning the sigmoidal parameters, which is a moderately complex task. Therefore, the difficulty is 'medium' due to the need for substantial data processing and potential methodological refinement.",
      "satellite_justification": "The layer is explicitly derived from 'modelled chlorophyll-a concentration data from satellite image analysis' (Copernicus marine). Satellite remote sensing is the primary data source for this layer and is crucial for its generation and improvement. Specifically, ocean color sensors provide chlorophyll-a concentration, which is the fundamental input for this layer. Updating the temporal period directly relies on continued satellite observations. Future improvements could also leverage higher spatial or temporal resolution satellite data if available, or integrate data from different satellite sensors for cross-validation or enhanced accuracy. Therefore, satellite remote sensing is absolutely central to generating and improving this layer."

      "improvement_justification": "The layer explicitly states that 'Shoreline complexity is a simplistic measure of ecological value' and recommends introducing 'additional predictive factors into a future model such as terrain morphology, coastal geology or exposure'. This indicates a fundamental need to move beyond a single, simplistic metric to a more comprehensive ecological assessment, which represents a substantial improvement requiring new modeling approaches and data integration.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements, such as integrating terrain morphology, coastal geology, and exposure, would require advanced technical expertise in GIS and ecological modeling. While some data might be available (e.g., geological maps), integrating these diverse datasets and developing a more sophisticated predictive model for ecological value would involve substantial data processing and methodological development, placing it in the 'medium' difficulty range. It's not 'high' as it doesn't necessarily require entirely new data collection campaigns from scratch for all factors, but rather integration and modeling of existing or readily available datasets.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can significantly contribute to improving this layer. Coastal and habitat mapping (e.g., identifying different coastal types, vegetation, and intertidal zones), land use and coastal development, and even some aspects of terrain morphology (e.g., through digital elevation models derived from satellite imagery or LiDAR) can be assessed or enhanced using satellite data. While direct 'coastal geology' might be challenging, proxies or related features can be observed. Exposure could potentially be inferred from wave patterns or coastal geomorphology visible from space. Therefore, satellite observations can help generate or improve several of the recommended additional predictive factors, moving beyond just shoreline length."

    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "There are a number of key limitations users should be aware of when using this dataset: 1) Only presence/absence data is available for sediment fractions in SGUs legacy sample inventory. Equal proportionality is assumed between the recorded sediment fractions but this may be invalid. 2) It was assumed that at least 20 replicates would be required to define the proportional makeup of each sediment class (in each sea area / depth / mapscale) . However, a power analysis was not undertaken to ensure sufficient sample availability for each surface substrate class and there is a significant range in replicate numbers between classes. 3) Where insufficient sample replication occurred to enable classification by depth, sea area and map scale data were averaged across depth ranges and between sea areas so certain classes are more reliable than others. 4) Surface substrates which form a veneer cover a smaller area of the seabed and consequently for some classes insufficient replicates were available for analysis. In this event the underlying sediment class was used for reclassification instead. In some classes on larger scale maps this might cause veneered sediments to be depicted as mixed proportions of the underlying substrate & veneer sediment fractions.",

Addressing these would require significant changes to data collection, processing, and modeling, leading to a substantial improvement in the layer's reliability and accuracy, moving beyond mere refinement.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements would be challenging. Validating model predictions with empirical data like particle size analysis requires extensive new in-situ data collection, which is resource-intensive. Undertaking a comprehensive power analysis to ensure sufficient sample availability for each sediment class is a complex statistical task. Gathering and harmonizing data from surrounding countries involves significant international coordination and data integration challenges. Addressing the 'equal proportionality' assumption and the reclassification of veneered sediments would likely necessitate new sampling strategies and/or advanced modeling approaches. These efforts require advanced technical expertise, substantial resources, and extensive data collection.",
      "satellite_justification": "This layer predicts the probability of occurrence of soft marine benthic substrates (mud, silt, clay) in aphotic zones. Satellite remote sensing primarily observes surface phenomena (e.g., water column properties, sea surface temperature, coastal morphology, shallow bathymetry in clear waters). While satellite-derived bathymetry can provide depth information, it is generally limited to shallower, clearer waters and would not directly inform the *type* of benthic substrate in aphotic zones. The core data for this layer (benthic substrate composition, sediment fractions) requires direct in-situ sampling (e.g., grab samples, cores) and laboratory analysis (e.g., particle size analysis). Satellite data cannot penetrate sufficiently to directly characterize deep, aphotic benthic substrates or their specific sediment fractions. Therefore, satellite observations cannot effectively generate or replace the fundamental data needed for this layer, nor can they directly validate the proportionality of sediment fractions."

    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "There are a number of key limitations users should be aware of when using this dataset: 1) Only presence/absence data is available for sediment fractions in SGUs legacy sample inventory. Equal proportionality is assumed between the recorded sediment fractions but this may be invalid. 2) It was assumed that at least 20 replicates would be required to define the proportional makeup of each sediment class (in each sea area / depth / mapscale) . However, a power analysis was not undertaken to ensure sufficient sample availability for each surface substrate class and there is a significant range in replicate numbers between classes. 3) Where insufficient sample replication occurred to enable classification by depth, sea area and map scale data were averaged across depth ranges and between sea areas so certain classes are more reliable than others. 4) Surface substrates which form a veneer cover a smaller area of the seabed and consequently for some classes insufficient replicates were available for analysis. In this event the underlying sediment class was used for reclassification instead. In some classes on larger scale maps this might cause veneered sediments to be depicted as mixed proportions of the underlying substrate & veneer sediment fractions.",

Equal proportionality is assumed between the recorded sediment fractions but this may be invalid. 2) It was assumed that at least 20 replicates would be required to define the proportional makeup of each sediment class (in each sea area / depth / mapscale) . However, a power analysis was not undertaken to ensure sufficient sample availability for each surface substrate class and there is a significant range in replicate numbers between classes. 3) Where insufficient sample replication occurred to enable classification by depth, sea area and map scale data were averaged across depth ranges and between sea areas so certain classes are more reliable than others. 4) Surface substrates which form a veneer cover a smaller area of the seabed and consequently for some classes insufficient replicates were available for analysis. In this event the underlying sediment class was used for reclassification instead. In some classes on larger scale maps this might cause veneered sediments to be depicted as mixed proportions of the underlying substrate & veneer sediment fractions.",

Gathering additional source data from surrounding countries implies complex international collaboration and data harmonization efforts. These are not minor adjustments but require substantial resources, advanced technical expertise, and extensive data collection.",
      "satellite_justification": "This layer focuses on soft bottom benthic substrates (mud, silt, clay) in the photic zone. While satellite remote sensing can provide information on water column properties (e.g., suspended sediments, water clarity which relates to photic depth), it cannot directly measure or classify benthic substrate types at the resolution and detail required for distinguishing mud, silt, and clay. Benthic substrate mapping typically relies on in-situ sampling (grab samples, cores), acoustic methods (multibeam, side-scan sonar), or underwater imagery. Satellite-derived bathymetry can provide depth, but not substrate composition. Therefore, satellite observations cannot effectively generate or significantly improve the core data of this layer, which is the probability of specific soft bottom substrate types."

    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "There are a number of key limitations users should be aware of when using this dataset: 1) Only presence/absence data is available for sediment fractions in SGUs legacy sample inventory. Equal proportionality is assumed between the recorded sediment fractions but this may be invalid. 2) It was assumed that at least 20 replicates would be required to define the proportional makeup of each sediment class (in each sea area / depth / mapscale) . However, a power analysis was not undertaken to ensure sufficient sample availability for each surface substrate class and there is a significant range in replicate numbers between classes. 3) Where insufficient sample replication occurred to enable classification by depth, sea area and map scale data were averaged across depth ranges and between sea areas so certain classes are more reliable than others. 4) Surface substrates which form a veneer cover a smaller area of the seabed and consequently for some classes insufficient replicates were available for analysis. In this event the underlying sediment class was used for reclassification instead. In some classes on larger scale maps this might cause veneered sediments to be depicted as mixed proportions of the underlying substrate & veneer sediment fractions.",

      "improvement_justification": "The limitations highlight fundamental issues with the source data (presence/absence, assumed proportionality, insufficient replicates, averaging across areas/depths, and issues with veneered sediments). The recommendations suggest a sensitivity analysis, validation with empirical data (e.g., particle size analysis), expert review, and gathering additional source data from surrounding countries. Addressing these would require significant re-evaluation of the underlying data and modeling approach, potentially leading to a fundamentally more robust and accurate layer, hence 'large' improvement potential.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommendations would be 'high' difficulty. Validating with empirical data like particle size analysis implies extensive new in-situ data collection. Undertaking a power analysis to ensure sufficient sample availability (as implied by limitation 2) would require significant effort. Harmonization with data from surrounding countries suggests complex cross-border data integration and standardization. The need for an 'expert review' and 'sensitivity analysis' further indicates a substantial methodological overhaul and resource commitment.",
      "satellite_justification": "This layer predicts the probability of soft marine benthic substrates (sand and gravel) in aphotic zones deeper than 60m. Satellite remote sensing primarily observes surface phenomena or properties that can be inferred from the surface (e.g., bathymetry in shallow, clear waters). Direct characterization of deep-water benthic substrates (sediment type) is not possible with current satellite technology. While satellite-derived bathymetry can provide depth, the core issue of sediment classification at these depths requires in-situ sampling (e.g., grab samples, cores) or acoustic methods (e.g., multibeam echosounder backscatter), which are not satellite-based. Therefore, satellite remote sensing cannot directly generate or significantly improve this specific layer's core data on sediment type."

      "satellite_justification": "While direct mapping of sub-surface sediment types (sand/gravel) in the photic zone is challenging for satellites due to water column attenuation and turbidity, satellite remote sensing can contribute to improving this layer. Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) could refine the depth model, especially in shallower photic zones, potentially improving the accuracy of the 'photic zone' boundary. Satellite imagery can also provide insights into water clarity (turbidity, suspended sediments) which directly impacts photic depth and could be used to refine the photic zone layer. Furthermore, satellite data on coastal geomorphology and sediment transport patterns (e.g., from changes in coastline or nearshore features) could indirectly inform the distribution of sand and gravel. While not a direct replacement for in-situ sediment sampling, satellite data can provide crucial contextual information and improve the accuracy of input layers like bathymetry and photic depth, thereby enhancing the overall model."

    "improvement_reasoning": {
      "improvement_justification": "While the layer states 'No limitations identified' and 'No recommendations suggested' by SLU, the lineage section reveals key aspects that suggest potential for improvement. The model relies on inventory point data from 2010-2015, which is now nearly a decade old. The interpolation method uses a 60 km search window and compensates for migration and land/water ratio. These are reasonable steps, but the lack of identified limitations or recommendations by SLU does not mean the model is perfect or cannot be improved. Potential improvements include: 1) Updating the underlying inventory data with more recent observations to reflect current distributions. 2) Refining the interpolation and modeling techniques, potentially incorporating environmental covariates (e.g., prey distribution, bathymetry, sea ice extent) that are known to influence seal distribution, which are not explicitly mentioned as being used in the current model. 3) Validating the model against independent datasets if available. The current model is a 'predicted distribution' based on inventory data, and its accuracy could likely be enhanced by incorporating more dynamic environmental factors or more recent observations. This falls under 'integrating multiple new data sources' and 'expanding methodological approaches'.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the suggested improvements would involve a 'medium' level of difficulty. Updating the inventory data would require new data collection efforts, which can be substantial but are part of ongoing monitoring programs. Refining the modeling techniques to incorporate environmental covariates would require advanced technical expertise in ecological modeling and data integration. This would likely involve collaboration between the Swedish Museum of Natural History (data source) and potentially other research institutions or agencies with expertise in marine ecological modeling. While not 'high' (which would imply major infrastructure changes), it's more than 'low' (which would be basic coordination or limited new data).",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing is 'false' for directly generating or significantly improving this specific Grey seal distribution layer. Grey seals are marine mammals that are typically observed at the surface or hauled out on land/ice. While satellites can provide environmental covariates that might influence seal distribution (e.g., sea surface temperature, sea ice extent, chlorophyll-a as an indicator of prey availability), they cannot directly detect individual seals or their abundance in the water column or under ice. The primary data for this layer comes from 'inventory point data' (likely visual surveys or tagging data). Satellite imagery could potentially be used to map haul-out sites on land or ice, but this is a different aspect of their life cycle than their predicted distribution in marine waters. Therefore, the core data for seal distribution remains in-situ measurements and biological sampling, which cannot be effectively replaced or directly supplemented by satellite observations for the purpose of generating the 'predicted distribution' raster layer."

However, the 'Maintenance: Not Planned' status for data from 2010-2015, combined with the use of a 40km search window for interpolation (a large home range for a seal), suggests significant potential for improvement. The data is nearly a decade old, and seal distributions can change due to environmental factors, prey availability, and human activity. A 'large' improvement potential exists in updating the temporal period, refining the spatial resolution and interpolation methods, and incorporating more dynamic environmental variables that influence seal distribution. The current model is based solely on inventory data, and a more sophisticated ecological model could significantly enhance its predictive power and accuracy.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the improvements would be 'high' difficulty. Updating the temporal period requires new national monitoring data collection, which is resource-intensive. Refining spatial resolution and interpolation methods would involve advanced geospatial analysis and potentially new modeling techniques (e.g., species distribution modeling incorporating environmental covariates). Incorporating dynamic environmental variables would require integrating diverse datasets (e.g., prey distribution, bathymetry, human disturbance) and developing complex ecological models. The 'Maintenance: Not Planned' status further indicates that significant effort and resources would be needed to overcome this lack of ongoing support.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing cannot directly generate or significantly improve this layer. Harbour seal distribution is primarily determined by in-situ observations (inventory data) and biological factors. While satellite data can provide environmental covariates (e.g., sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a, bathymetry, coastal changes) that might influence seal distribution or prey availability, they cannot directly observe seal abundance or distribution at the resolution and accuracy required for this layer. The core data (seal presence/abundance) must come from in-situ surveys. Satellite data could potentially be used as input variables for a more advanced species distribution model, but they cannot replace the fundamental in-situ inventory data."

A cell value of 0 is equivalent to a low probability of occurrence and a cell value of 100 is equivalent to a high probability of occurrence. Underlying data consists of benthic substrate data (1975-2015), depth data (2013, 2015), and photic zone data. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales.

Predictions of hardbottom substrate class (i.e. rocks, boulders, and bedrock) were combined and extracted from the region within the photic zone using conditional statements in ArcGIS raster calculator.",
    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "There are a number of key limitations users should be aware of when using this dataset: 1) Only presence/absence data is available for sediment fractions in SGUs legacy sample inventory. Equal proportionality is assumed between the recorded sediment fractions but this may be invalid. 2) It was assumed that at least 20 replicates would be required to define the proportional makeup of each sediment class (in each sea area / depth / mapscale) . However, a power analysis was not undertaken to ensure sufficient sample availability for each surface substrate class and there is a significant range in replicate numbers between classes. 3) Where insufficient sample replication occured to enable classification by depth, sea area and map scale data were averaged across depth ranges and between sea areas so certain classes are more reliable than others. 4) Surface substrates which form a veneer cover a smaller area of the seabed and consequently for some classes insufficient replicates were available for analysis. In this event the underlying sediment class was used for reclassification instead. In some classes on larger scale maps this might cause veneered sediments to be depicted as mixed proportions of the underlying substrate & veneer sediment fractions.",
    "recommendations_for_data_improvement": "Apply a sensitivity analysis approach to determine the overall consequence of misclassification. Review the approach to proportionality by validating the model predictions with empirical data (e.g. particle size analysis data). Undertake an expert review. Gather additional source data from surrounding countries to produce better harmonisation.",

    "improvement_reasoning": {
      "improvement_justification": "The limitations highlight fundamental issues with the underlying data (presence/absence, assumed proportionality, insufficient replication, veneer issues) and the methodology (no power analysis, averaging across areas/depths). The recommendations suggest sensitivity analysis, empirical validation, expert review, and gathering data from surrounding countries. Addressing these would require significant re-evaluation of the data foundation and modeling approach, leading to a substantially more robust and accurate layer, hence 'large' improvement potential.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommendations would be 'high' difficulty. Validating proportionality with empirical data (e.g., particle size analysis) implies extensive new in-situ data collection. Undertaking a power analysis requires significant statistical expertise and potentially more data. Harmonizing data with surrounding countries is a major international coordination effort. Re-evaluating the underlying sediment classification and addressing veneer issues would require advanced modeling and potentially new survey methods. These are not minor tweaks but fundamental overhauls.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can contribute to improving this layer, particularly through satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) which could enhance the depth model, especially in shallower, optically clear waters within the photic zone. While direct 'hard bottom' detection is challenging for satellite, SDB can provide higher resolution and more consistent depth data than traditional surveys in some areas, which is a key input to this layer. Additionally, satellite imagery could potentially aid in identifying areas of high turbidity or water clarity, which might influence the effective photic depth, though the current photic layer is likely based on modeled light penetration. Habitat mapping from satellite could also provide broader contextual information, though direct hard bottom classification is limited. Therefore, 'true' as satellite data can enhance a key input (depth) and potentially inform the photic zone component."

    "lineage": "These data were prepared primarily from acoustic monitoring data collected during the SAMBAH project between 2011 and 2013. The probability of encountering porpoises was calculated from measurements of sounds emitted from the animals. The study included animals in the Baltic Sea between Åland and the Belt Sea (see method description in Static Acoustic Monitoring of the Baltic Harbor porpoise, SAMBAH, non-technical report http://www.sambah.org/Non-technical-report-v.-1.8.1.pdf). Summer and winter data were provided and these were combined (mean average) to produce an annual dataset for Symphony. The SAMBAH project (See SAMBAH Non- technical report) suggests a limit of the Baltic porpoise population. At this suggested demarcation line was therefore used to isolate the Baltic Population for separate treatment in Symphony. Data were extrapolated using an inverse distance weighting algorithmn to avoid a sharp break. Values were normalized between 0 - 100 using a linear transformation (where 100 represents the maximum value in the data). The were then resampled to a 250mx250m grid. More detailed information on the lineage and methodology is available and can be supplied on request to the data owner.",

The demarcation generates a fictitious decline in the Baltic population in the west-southwest direction, which does not correspond to real conditions.",

      "improvement_justification": "The primary limitation explicitly states a 'fictitious decline' in the Baltic porpoise population due to an arbitrary interpolation and demarcation, which 'does not correspond to real conditions'. This fundamental misrepresentation of population distribution indicates a large potential for improvement, requiring a re-evaluation of the spatial modeling and potentially new data collection to accurately represent the population boundary and density gradient.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Addressing the 'fictitious decline' and arbitrary boundary would require significant effort. It would likely involve advanced spatial modeling techniques beyond simple inverse distance weighting, potentially new acoustic monitoring campaigns to better define the population boundary and density in the critical transition zone, and expert biological input to refine the understanding of population dynamics. This implies substantial new data collection and advanced technical expertise.",
      "satellite_justification": "The data for this layer are derived from acoustic monitoring of porpoise sounds. Satellite remote sensing cannot directly detect marine mammal presence or acoustic emissions. While satellite data can provide environmental parameters (e.g., sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a) that might correlate with porpoise distribution, they cannot generate the core porpoise presence/density data. The layer's foundation is acoustic, requiring in-situ measurements that satellites cannot provide or effectively supplement."

Underlying data are modelled population density data generated from tracking of 78 satellite-tagged porpoises during two periods between 1997 and 2016 by Aarhus University. These modelled data were then normalized and log transformed for use in Symphony. A cell value of 0 shows areas where no porpoises are predicted and a cell value of 100 is equivalent to the maximum average annual population density (within the Swedish EEZ). These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales.

    "lineage": "Since 1997, Aarhus University (AU) has been attaching satellite transmitters on harbour porpoises incidentally caught in pound nets in the inner Danish waters (Kattegat, Belt Seas, the Sound and the western Baltic). For detailed description of tagging methodology see Sveegaard et al. (2011a). The telemetry tracking data allows for a detailed view of movement of the individual porpoises. However, by combining data from several porpoises, a good overview of the entire porpoise population distribution may be obtained. Such a study was published in 2011 containing the data from 64 porpoises tagged from 1997 – 2007 (Sveegaard et al. 2011). From 2007 to 2016, Aarhus University have tagged an additional 56 individuals i.e. 120 harbour porpoises in total. Data from 18 individuals were removed prior to further\nanalysis by Aarhus due to data quality issues.\nThe data from 78 animals (located in the Belt Sea area) were\nanalysed by Aarhus univeristity using kernel density\nestimation (KDE) generating summer, winter and annual\ndatasets. A detail description of the KDE method can be\nfound in Sveegaard et al 2011 data were filtered using a DAR\nfilter (Distance, Angle, Rate, Douglas Argos filter v7.03) to 1\nlocation per porpoise per day. KDE were performed using\nthe ArcToolbox in ArcGIS v. 10.3. Grid size = 1x1 km,\nsmoothing factor = 20.000 and each animal were weighted\nequally in the analysis.\nIn preparation for use in Symphony only the annual data\nwere used and these data were logarithmically transformed\nand normalised. The data were transformed using a (Log10\n(cell value + 1) calculation in ArcGIS. Values were then\nnormalized (linear rescale in ArcGIS) between 0 - 100 with\n100 representing the maximum value within the Swedish\nEEZ.\nThe were then resampled to the 250mx250m Symphony\ngrid.\nMore detailed information on the lineage and methodology\nis available and can be supplied on request to the data\nowner.\nMethod reference:\nSveegaard, S., Teilmann, J., Tougaard, J., Dietz, R.,\nMouritsen, K.N., Desportes, G., Siebert, U., 2011.

    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "These data are based on porpoises which were caught in Danish waters, this may lead to sampling bias (when intending to represent populations in Swedish waters). The porpoise population data were log transformed before being used in Symphony – this ‘smooths’ the data providing a more general data trend. It is intended to ensure the data is conservatively interpreted. Smoothing the data does however decrease the spatial specificity and the relative importance of specific spatial ‘hotspots’ which could be linked for example to seabed features.",
    "recommendations_for_data_improvement": "The effect of pressures on the different populations (i.e. Belt-sea, Baltic and North Sea population) should be evaluated separately as sensitivity may vary due to the large difference in total population size. Collection of additional data from animals in Swedish waters would enhance data quality. Further work to test for spatial relationships between the porpoise population and predictor\nvariables (e.g. seabed/water column features) might provide additional insight relevant to\nspatial planning.",

The primary data source for this layer is in-situ animal tagging and subsequent movement modeling, which is not replaceable or directly enhanced by satellite observations of the marine environment itself.

    "lineage": "Since 1997, Aarhus University (AU) has been attaching satellite transmitters on harbour porpoises incidentally caught in pound nets in the inner Danish waters (Kattegat, Belt Seas, the Sound and the western Baltic). For detailed description of tagging\nmethodology see Sveegaard et al. (2011a). The telemetry tracking\ndata allows for a detailed view of movement of the individual\nporpoises. However, by combining data from several porpoises, a\ngood overview of the entire porpoise population distribution may\nbe obtained. Such a study was published in 2011 containing the\ndata from 64 porpoises tagged from 1997 – 2007 (Sveegaard et al.\n2011). From 2007 to 2016, Aarhus University have tagged an\nadditional 56 individuals i.e. 120 harbour porpoises in total. Data\nfrom 18 individuals were removed prior to further analysis by\nAarhus due to data quality issues.\nThe data from 62 animals (located in the North Sea area) were\nanalysed by Aarhus univeristity using kernel density estimation\n(KDE) generating summer, winter and annual datasets. A detail\ndescription of the KDE method can be found in Sveegaard et al\n2011 data were filtered using a DAR filter (Distance, Angle, Rate,\nDouglas Argos filter v7.03) to 1 location per porpoise per day.\nKDE were performed using the ArcToolbox in ArcGIS v. 10.3. Grid\nsize = 1x1 km, smoothing factor = 20.000 and each animal were\nweighted equally in the analysis.\nIn preparation for use in Symphony only the annual data were\nused these data were then logarithmically transformed and\nnormalised. The data were transformed using a (Log10 (cell value\n+ 1) calculation in ArcGIS. Values were then normalized (linear\nrescale in ArcGIS) between 0 - 100 with 100 representing the\nmaximum value within the Swedish EEZ.\nThe were then resampled to the 250mx250m Symphony grid.\nMore detailed information on the lineage and methodology is\navailable and can be supplied on request to the data owner.\nMethod reference:\nSveegaard, S., Teilmann, J., Tougaard, J., Dietz, R., Mouritsen,\nK.N., Desportes, G., Siebert, U., 2011.

    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "These data are based on porpoises which were caught in Danish waters, this may lead to sampling bias (when intending to represent populations in Swedish waters). The porpoise population data were log transformed before being used in Symphony – this ‘smooths’ the data providing a more general data trend. It is intended to ensure the data is conservatively interpreted. Smoothing the data does however decrease the spatial specificity and the relative importance of specific spatial ‘hotspots’ which could be linked for example to seabed features.",
    "recommendations_for_data_improvement": " The effect of pressures on the different populations (i.e. Belt-sea, Baltic and North Sea\npopulation) should be evaluated separately as sensitivity may vary due to the large difference\nin total population size.\nCollection of additional data from animals in Swedish waters would enhance data quality in\nfuture analyses.",

      "improvement_justification": "The limitations explicitly state a significant sampling bias due to porpoises being caught only in Danish waters, which may not accurately represent populations in Swedish waters. The recommendation directly addresses this by suggesting 'Collection of additional data from animals in Swedish waters'. This requires new, targeted data collection (tagging and tracking) in a different geographical area, which is a fundamental change to the data source and would substantially improve the representativeness and accuracy of the layer for its intended use in Swedish marine planning. Additionally, the recommendation to evaluate different populations separately implies a need for more nuanced modeling, potentially requiring more specific data for each population.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the primary recommendation of 'Collection of additional data from animals in Swedish waters' involves significant logistical and technical challenges. It requires new animal capture and tagging operations, which are resource-intensive, require specialized expertise (veterinary, tagging, tracking), and involve extensive fieldwork over potentially long periods. This is not a simple refinement but a substantial new data acquisition effort. Furthermore, evaluating different populations separately might require more complex modeling approaches and potentially more targeted data collection for each, adding to the difficulty.",
      "satellite_justification": "The core data for this layer is derived from satellite-tagged porpoises, which track individual animal movements. While the 'satellite' in 'satellite-tagged' refers to the communication method for transmitting location data, the actual data being collected (animal movement and density) is biological and behavioral. Satellite remote sensing, as typically understood (e.g., ocean color, SST, bathymetry), cannot directly generate or improve porpoise population density data based on individual tracking. While environmental factors derived from satellite data (like SST or chlorophyll) could potentially be used as covariates in future porpoise habitat models, they cannot replace the fundamental need for direct animal tracking data to address the sampling bias or collect data from specific populations. The limitation and recommendation specifically point to the need for more in-situ animal tracking data, not broader environmental parameters from satellites."

    "improvement_reasoning": {
      "improvement_justification": "The layer's 'Limitations' and 'Recommendations' sections explicitly state 'No limitations identified by SLU' and 'No recommendations suggested by SLU'. This indicates a lack of critical self-assessment or external review regarding potential improvements. However, the 'Lineage' section reveals significant methodological limitations: 1. Data are from 2010-2015, making them potentially outdated for current planning. 2. The interpolation method uses a fixed 60 km search window, which is a large 'home range' for a species like the Ringed Seal and may oversimplify distribution, especially in complex coastal environments. 3. The compensation for land/water ratio is a basic adjustment and might not fully capture habitat suitability. 4. The normalization to 'Symphony requirements' is vague and could obscure underlying data characteristics. 5. The 'Maintenance: Not Planned' status is a major limitation, as seal populations and their distributions are dynamic. Addressing these fundamental issues, including updating data, refining spatial modeling, and incorporating more dynamic environmental variables, represents a large potential for improvement.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the necessary improvements would be 'high' difficulty. Updating the data would require new national monitoring efforts, which are resource-intensive. Refining the spatial modeling would involve advanced ecological modeling techniques, potentially incorporating habitat suitability models, oceanographic data, and more sophisticated interpolation or machine learning approaches. This would require significant technical expertise and computational resources. Furthermore, integrating dynamic environmental variables (e.g., ice cover, prey availability) would necessitate access to and processing of large, often real-time, datasets. The lack of planned maintenance also implies a need for sustained funding and institutional commitment.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can significantly help generate and improve this layer. Ringed seals are highly dependent on sea ice for breeding, resting, and molting. Satellite data can provide crucial information on: 1. Sea ice concentration, extent, and thickness (e.g., from passive microwave radiometers, synthetic aperture radar - SAR). This is a primary driver of Ringed Seal distribution and can be monitored dynamically. 2. Sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (ocean color) can indicate prey availability (e.g., fish, crustaceans) which influences seal foraging grounds. 3. Coastal and habitat mapping (e.g., identifying suitable haul-out sites, ice-covered areas near land) can be enhanced with high-resolution optical and SAR imagery. While direct counting of seals from space is generally not feasible for this species, satellite data can provide critical environmental covariates that drive their distribution, allowing for more accurate and dynamic predictive modeling than the current static, interpolated layer. This would move beyond simple interpolation to a more ecologically informed distribution model."

Source data are from the North American Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and are based on the Representative Concentration Pathway climate forecast model - RCP8.5 which is a baseline climate scenario ( with comparatively high greenhouse gas emissions) . A cell value of zero is equivalent to no change in ocean acidity by the year 2050 and a cell value of 100 equates to a pH decrease of 0.2 by 2050. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",

    "lineage": "The raster shows sea acidification by 2050, modelled by NOAA with scenario RCP8.5 (note - RCP stands for representative concentration pathway which is a set of socio-economic assumptions which are used to build a climate scenario. In this scenario there is a rising radiative forcing pathway leading with human emissions resulting in a 8.5 watts per square meter output by 2100. This is a high global anthropogenic radiative forcing scenario. Details about the scenario can be found here: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10584-011-0149-y Two datasets from NOAAs geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory were downloaded from https://esg-dn1.nsc.liu.se/search/cmip5/ Data ID = cmip5.output1.NOAA-GFDL.GFDL- ESM2G.rcp85.yr.ocnBgchem.Oyr.r1i1p1.v20110601|esgdata.gfdl.noaa.gov Data ID = cmip5.output1.NOAA-GFDL.GFDL- ESM2M.rcp85.yr.ocnBgchem.Oyr.r1i1p1.v20110601|esgdata.gfdl.noaa.go v Ocean acidity data were extracted from the NetCDF files for the baseline (a mean of the 2006-2010) and for the 2050 prediction (mean of the 2046-2050 period) The coordinate system was transformed from tripole grid to ETRS89 and these point data were interpolated to create raster data layers. The rasters were resample to the standard 250m symphony grid. For each model the difference between the baseline dataset and the modelled 2050 future was calculated and a single pH change dataset was created. The average of the ESM2G / ESM2M ocean oriented earth system model runs was used for the final product. The raster was then normalized (linear stretch) to values between 0 - 100 where maximum value 100 = 0.2 pH increase (the maximum average predicted increase).",

While satellites can measure parameters that influence ocean chemistry (e.g., sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a which relates to primary production and CO2 uptake), they cannot directly provide pH values or the change in pH due to acidification. The core data for this layer (ocean acidity prediction) relies on biogeochemical models and in-situ measurements for calibration and validation, not direct satellite observation."

It's more than just refining existing methods but less than a complete overhaul requiring entirely new infrastructure.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can directly contribute to improving this layer, particularly for sea surface temperature (SST). While the core data comes from climate models, satellite SST observations can be used for: 1. Validation: Comparing model outputs (especially for the baseline period or historical trends) with satellite-derived SST to assess model accuracy and bias. 2. Gap-filling/Interpolation: Potentially assisting in interpolating or providing context for areas where model data is missing or uniform (e.g., Skagerrak, Kattegat), although this would be for observed SST, not future predictions directly. 3. Baseline Refinement: Satellite SST data could help refine the 'baseline mean 2010-2029' if the model's baseline is found to deviate significantly from observed conditions. However, the primary improvement for future predictions still relies on climate models. The mention of 'deep water conditions' is less directly addressable by current satellite technology, which primarily measures surface properties. Nevertheless, for the surface component, satellite SST is a highly relevant and valuable data source for validation and contextualization."

      "improvement_justification": "The layer has large potential for improvement due to several factors. Firstly, the 'Limitations' section explicitly states that the current model 'assumes that habitat change due to development equates to loss' and 'This is not considered in these data' that 'habitat may be created due to development'. This indicates a fundamental simplification that could lead to inaccurate assessments of impact. Addressing this would require a more nuanced modeling approach. Secondly, the 'Recommendations' suggest updating with 'latest data (currently under production by METRIA)', which implies a significant data refresh is needed. Thirdly, the recommendation to 'Determine if there is a requirement to extract certain development types for addition to an artificial reef dataset' suggests a potential for re-purposing or refining the data for other applications, indicating a need for more granular data or analysis. Finally, the lack of justification for weighting (e.g., 'is there some evidence to justify why harbours are given a 10 times higher impact score?') points to a need for a more robust, evidence-based methodology for impact scoring, which could significantly alter the output.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the improvements would be of medium difficulty. Updating with the latest data from METRIA, while crucial, would involve data acquisition and integration, which can be time-consuming but is a standard data management task. Justifying the weighting of different development types would require research, potentially expert consultation, and a re-evaluation of the impact model, which is a moderately complex task. Addressing the limitation regarding habitat creation versus loss would likely involve more sophisticated spatial modeling and potentially new data sources (e.g., habitat mapping before and after development), requiring advanced technical expertise. Extracting specific development types for an artificial reef dataset would require detailed spatial analysis and potentially re-categorization of existing data. While not 'high' (which would imply entirely new data collection campaigns or major infrastructure changes), these tasks go beyond simple data updates and require methodological adjustments and potentially new analytical approaches.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can significantly help generate and improve this layer. Coastal development, including houses, buildings, harbours, marinas, jetties, and docks, can be effectively monitored and mapped using high-resolution satellite imagery (e.g., optical imagery for land use and coastal development). Changes in coastal morphology, the presence of new structures, and the extent of developed areas can be detected and quantified. Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) could potentially assist in understanding the nearshore environment where these structures are built. While the current layer uses existing shapefiles, satellite data could provide a more frequent, consistent, and up-to-date source for detecting and mapping these features, especially for updating the layer with the 'latest data'. Furthermore, satellite imagery could potentially be used to assess habitat change (e.g., changes in seagrass beds or intertidal habitats) in response to development, providing data to address the limitation that 'habitat may be created due to development' which is not currently considered. This would involve advanced image analysis techniques for habitat mapping and change detection."

    "summary": "This raster intends to show areas where potential habitat loss can occur from dredge spoil dumping in Swedish coastal and offshore waters. Underlying data are from two sources of data which consist of a point vector dataset detailing the location of licensed dredge disposal sites (from 2014) and benthic substrate data (from 2006). The dataset is binary and a cell value of 0 is equivalent to no risk of habitat loss due dredge spoil dumping and a cell value of 100 is equivalent to a risk of habitat loss due to dredge spoil dumping. Note that no specific information were available in a national data archive detailing the source, type and volume of sediment being dumped. This has been approximated\nthrough analysis of surrounding sediment types. These data\nwere created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool\ndeveloped by the marine planning unit at the Swedish\nAgency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM).\nSymphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative\nenvironmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters\nand this informs the formulation of policy at plan area\nscales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only\nadvisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",
    "summary_swedish": "Detta rasterskikt avser att visa områden där habitatförlust potentiellt kan förekomma på grund av dumpning av muddermassor i svenska kust- och havsvatten. Underlagsdata härrör från två datakällor bestående av ett rasterskikt med punktvektorer som specificerar plats för licensierade muddringsanläggningar (från 2014), och bentisk substratdata (från 2006). Detta rasterskikt är binärt och ett cellvärde av 0 motsvarar ingen risk för habitatförlust på grund av dumpning av muddermassor, ett cellvärde av 100 motsvarar risk för habitatförlust på grund av dumpning av muddermassor. Observera att ingen specifik information fanns tillgänglig i nationella dataarkiv angående källa, typ och volym av dumpade sediment istället har detta skattats utifrån analys av omgivningens sediment. Denna data skapades som ett data input layer för ’Symphony’ verktyget utvecklat av enheten för havsplaneringen på Havs- och vattenmyndigheten (HaV). Symphony används av HaV för bedömning av den kumulativa miljöpåverkan av mänsklig aktivitet i svenska vatten och används vid havsplanering. Återanvändning av denna data för andra ändamål är endast lämpligt efter vägledning och rådgivning av datakällorna.",
    "lineage": "This data was created based on the assumption that dumping spoils with a different grain size will lead to habitat loss in the short term (although this is likely reversible). Two source datasets were used in the model. The location of licenced dredge disposal sites was provided by the Geological Survey of Sweden and this was in turn derived from data supplied by the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). The second dataset used was dominant sediment type derived from Helcom's 2006 Balance project. Each point location record was allocated the bottom substrate type derived from the sediment dataset using a spatial join and then each site was buffered by 200m. A comparison of the sediment type at each site and the nearest port was undertaken and differences between sediment types were used to guide a spatial selection of sites which are\nlikely to result in habitat loss.\nThese vector data were then translated to a binary raster file\nmatching the Symphony grid specification.",
    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "Metadata indicates that substrate data from HELCOM's 2006 Balance project was used rather than the updated substrate data produced by SGU for this project. The sites are buffered by 200m (note that this means some sites cover 1 cell and others 3 depending on the location of the point).",
    "recommendations_for_data_improvement": "Data detailing the location sites licenced for dredge dumping sites is not well managed. The locations of dumpsites were updated to 2015 by SGU based on information provided by SwAM but no attribution for example detailing the quantities of sediment were available so it was not possible to model the relative impact at different sites. This could be improved in a future model iteration. There are currently some data on HELCOM's portal (HOLAS 2) and EMODNET human activities portal detailing dumping sites but little metadata is available.",

      "improvement_justification": "The layer has large potential for improvement because it relies on outdated benthic substrate data (2006 vs. updated SGU data) and lacks crucial information on the source, type, and volume of sediment being dumped. The current approximation based on surrounding sediment types is a significant limitation. Incorporating updated substrate data, actual dumping quantities, and potentially modeling the dispersion and deposition of different sediment types would fundamentally improve the accuracy and utility of this layer for assessing habitat loss.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the necessary improvements would be difficult. It requires better management and availability of licensed dredge dumping site data, including attribution for quantities of sediment, which is explicitly stated as not well managed. This likely involves significant coordination between multiple agencies (SwAM, SGU, HELCOM, EMODNET) to establish standardized data collection and sharing protocols for dumping activities. Furthermore, modeling the relative impact at different sites based on sediment quantities and types would require advanced modeling capabilities and potentially new data collection methods.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing cannot directly generate or significantly improve this layer. The core data needed are precise locations of dredge spoil dumping sites, the volume and type of sediment dumped, and detailed benthic substrate composition. While satellites can provide some broad-scale information like suspended sediment plumes (which might indicate dumping events), they cannot quantify the volume or type of dumped material, nor can they directly map sub-surface benthic habitats with the resolution and detail required to assess habitat loss from specific dumping events. Benthic substrate data, especially for detailed habitat mapping, typically requires in-situ measurements, acoustic surveys, or biological sampling, which are beyond current satellite capabilities for this specific application."

These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM).

      "improvement_justification": "The limitations explicitly state that significant features like docks, piers, offshore navigational features (buoys, markers), and offshore wind farm turbines are not included. The recommendation to add these features, along with gathering attribution on feature dimensions to refine the model (moving beyond a simplistic 25m buffer), indicates a high potential for substantial improvement. This goes beyond minor refinements and requires integrating multiple new data sources and potentially advanced modeling for more accurate habitat loss representation.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommendations involves integrating data from multiple external agencies (Swedish National Grid, Swedish Maritime Authority, Swedish Environmental Protection Agency), which requires inter-agency collaboration. Gathering 'attribution on feature dimensions' implies a need for more detailed spatial data than simple point or line features, potentially requiring advanced GIS processing or even new data collection methods for specific features. While not 'high' (which would imply major infrastructure changes), it's more than 'low' due to the need for substantial new data collection and coordination.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can contribute to improving this layer. Specifically, satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) could potentially assist in refining the 'in the sea' vs 'on land' distinction for coastal features, especially in shallow waters where the 25m buffer is applied. High-resolution satellite imagery could also aid in identifying and mapping some coastal infrastructure like larger docks and piers, or even verifying the presence and extent of features like bridges and pipelines, especially for manual position corrections. While not directly generating the core infrastructure data, it can enhance the accuracy of spatial delineation and potentially identify missing features in coastal areas, thereby improving the layer's completeness and accuracy."

This involves advanced technical expertise in spatial modeling, data fusion, and potentially hydrological modeling, as well as substantial coordination across multiple organizations (SwAM, SEPA, County Admin Boards, SGU).",

Water quality indicators such as chlorophyll-a, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) can be derived from ocean color sensors, providing empirical data for validating and refining the spatial risk model of pollution. Satellite-derived bathymetry could inform current modeling in shallow coastal areas. Land use and coastal development data from satellite imagery could help contextualize potential pollution sources and their proximity to sensitive areas. While direct 'synthetic toxin' detection is not typically possible, proxies and environmental conditions influencing their transport and fate (e.g., turbidity, algal blooms as indicators of eutrophication often linked to wastewater) can be monitored. This empirical data can move the layer beyond a purely proximity-based assessment towards one informed by actual environmental conditions and impacts."

A cell value of 0 is equivalent to 70 kPa peak overpressure or less and a cell value of 100 is equivalent to 2500 kPa peak overpressure or more at 52 occasions per year. Underlying data consists of presence data in the form of shapefiles that have then been modelled. This raster refers to pressure waves (which may impact all marine life), these spread less efficiently through the water than sound so sound / noise from explosions are represented separately in a layer named 'Explosion SEL'. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",

The 'discussion on the method did not occur' between the consultant and the Armed Forces, indicating a current lack of established data exchange, which adds to the difficulty.",
      "satellite_justification": "The layer models peak overpressure from underwater explosions. This phenomenon is directly related to the physical properties of the explosion (e.g., TNT equivalent, depth) and the propagation of pressure waves through water. Satellite remote sensing primarily observes surface phenomena (e.g., ocean color, temperature, surface waves, land use). While satellites can detect some surface expressions of underwater events (e.g., large-scale disturbances, oil spills), they cannot directly measure or infer underwater pressure wave propagation or the specific characteristics of an underwater explosion that determine peak overpressure. The data needed (detonation location, type, frequency, loading weights) are in-situ operational data from the military, not observable from space. Therefore, satellite data cannot help generate or improve this specific layer."

The lineage notes 'insufficient information available from the Swedish Armed Forces' and 'discussion on the method did not occur between WSP (consultant) and the Swedish Armed Forces'. This indicates a significant hurdle in inter-organizational data sharing and collaboration, likely involving security concerns and bureaucratic processes. Gathering this data would require high-level agreements and potentially new data collection protocols from the Armed Forces, making it a 'high' difficulty task.",
      "satellite_justification": "The core data needed for improvement relates to the specific characteristics of underwater explosions (loading weights, precise locations, frequency, and resulting sound exposure levels). Satellite remote sensing cannot directly detect or measure underwater acoustic events, nor can it provide information on the type or force of an explosion. While satellites can monitor surface conditions (e.g., ship movements, which might indirectly indicate activity), they cannot provide the direct, in-situ measurements of underwater sound or the specific details of the detonation events themselves that are required to improve this layer. The data gaps are inherently sub-surface and event-specific, requiring direct measurement or detailed reporting from the source."

It was assumed that larger artillery are used in larger firing ranges. 3) Concentric ring buffers were generated from the centroid of the coastal intersection points. 4) Allocate a stepwise score with distance for large ranges 10 - 5km, 30 - 10km, 30 - 15km, 80 - 20km, 60 - 25km, 50 - 30km, 40 - 35km, 30 - 40km, 20 - 45km, 10 > 50km 5) Allocate a stepwise score with distance for medium ranges 10 - 2km, 30 - 4km, 30 - 6km, 80 - 8km, 60 - 10km, 50 - 12km, 40 - 14km, 30 - 16km, 20 - 18km, 10 > 20km 6) Allocate a stepwise score with distance for small ranges 10 - 0.5km, 30 - 1km, 30 - 1.5km, 80 - 2km, 60 - 2.5km, 50 - 3km, 40 - 3.5km, 30 - 4km, 20 - 4.5km, 10 > 5km Note - the spread of fire was assumed to be in an arc with the\ndominant area of impact fairly close but diminishing with\ndistance.\n7) All remaining areas (non funnel shaped) were assumed to\nbe areas with only small arms fire and therefore were\nallocated an impact score of 10\n8) All data layers were combined into a single raster layer\n9) A spatial filter was applied to blur the data (focal\nstatistics, 5km mean)\n10) Data were rescaled on a 0-100 scale and clipped to the\nSymphony Grid.",

This requires advanced technical expertise and substantial coordination.",

Satellite remote sensing is primarily effective for surface-level phenomena (e.g., ocean color, SST, surface currents, suspended sediments, oil spills) or features that influence surface reflectance (e.g., bathymetry in clear, shallow waters). It cannot directly detect or quantify heavy metal concentrations in marine sediments, nor can it provide information on historical firing patterns, munition types, or the specific metal content of munitions.

    "lineage": "Data were from the Swedish National Grid (SVK) and included a shape file of offshore wind farms. Data processing was as follows: The distance from the nearest wind power turbines was calculated using a buffer with a fixed distance (500, 1000, 1500, 2250 and 3000 m). The values were aggregated where “the highest value wins”. There is no general rule that dictates distance for avoidance of wind power turbines by seabirds but is instead species and location specific. The lower limit of 3000 m is a theoretical impact distance for avoidance behaviour by seabirds that has been mentioned in environmental impact assessments (Ramböll, 2015). However, the literature does not demonstrate that a known avoidance occurs down to this distance (e.g. the so called synthesis report from Vindval, Green et al., 2011 specifies, as a rule, avoidance at less than 500 m and typically at approx. 100-200 m, with the exception of loons where reduced density has been demonstrated down to approx. 2km). Normalisation was linear\nwith respect to the areal impact, where areas outside of the\ntheoretical impact areas (i.e. > 3000 m) were assigned a cell value\nof 0 and areas within 500 m of wind power turbines were assigned\na cell value of 100. Discussion of the method occurred between\nWSP (consultant) and SWaM (client).\nMore detailed information on the lineage and methodology is\navailable and can be supplied on request to the data owner.",
    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "The model accuracy is approximately 3 km however there are no documented general \"avoidance distances\" for multiple species or even multiple sites so that data should be used with some caution. It may also be important to note that avoidance studies often fail to describe the spatial scale of avoidance and they affected by weather and other behavioural factors. The height of the wind turbines are not included in this model. Mitigation of windfarm construction includes building higher turbines which can theoretically reduce the risk of collision (for some species) - see https://www.bto.org/sites/default/files/u28/downloads/Projects/Final_Report_SOSS02 _BTOReview.pdf.",

      "improvement_justification": "The layer's core limitation is the lack of documented, species- and site-specific avoidance distances and the spatial scale of avoidance. The recommendations explicitly call for commissioning research and gathering evidence on these fundamental aspects, including flight heights and turbine dimensions. Addressing these would require significant new data collection and potentially advanced modeling, leading to a substantial improvement in the layer's accuracy and ecological relevance beyond simple buffer calculations.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommendations involves commissioning new research, which implies extensive field studies (e.g., bird tracking, behavioral observations), potentially over long periods and across multiple sites and species. Gathering attribution on wind farm turbine dimensions and integrating this into a risk model also adds complexity. This requires significant resources, advanced technical expertise in ecological modeling and data collection, and likely extensive collaboration between research institutions, government agencies, and industry.",
      "satellite_justification": "The primary data needed to improve this layer are detailed behavioral observations of seabirds (avoidance distances, flight heights) in relation to wind turbines, and specific turbine dimensions. These are inherently in-situ measurements or require direct observation/engineering data. While satellite data can provide context (e.g., sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a for habitat characterization), it cannot directly measure individual bird avoidance behavior, flight heights, or the physical dimensions of turbines with the necessary resolution or directness to address the core limitations of this specific layer. Bird tracking (e.g., GPS tags) is a more relevant technology, but it is not satellite remote sensing in the context of broad-area environmental monitoring."

    "lineage": "With the assistance of a generalised spreading model (RL = SL – TL) the Received Level (RL) of sound was calculated for all cells in the SYMPHONY at a frequency of 125 Hz. SL = Source level. Transmission loss (TL) was calculated as a function of the distance from the source (distance) as well as bottom substrate character at the source. For shallow (<30M) bottom with hard sediment character the function 15 × log(distance) was used and for other conditions the function 20 × log(distance) was used. Bottom substrate classification was based on maps of bottom substrate purpose produced by the Geological Survey of Sweden (SGU) for SYMPHONY. Bottom substrates where the proportion of soft bottom was > 50% were defined as having soft sediment character. The aggregated sound from all wind power turbines over a year were combined and converted to sound intensity. The yearly average was calculated and then converted to sound volume expressed in average decibels (dBavg), which was calculated as follows: dBavg =10 × log10(∑∆t/T×(10)^((RL intensity/10)) summed over all ∆t under the whole time period T (1 year alternatively 6 months). The source sound volume that was applied was 136 dB at a frequency of 127 Hz (integrated over the frequency range 123 – 132 Hz), which was measured at Lillgrund as a conservative ‘worst case’ in the upper range for existing wind power turbines. The values for the wind power park at Middelgrunden, Bockstigen and Vindeby demonstrate source volumes < 136 dB (Miller, 2009, Underwater noise from three types of offshore wind turbines, Andersson et al, 2011, Vindval rapport 6436). A value of 114 dB at a one-third octave band centered on 125 Hz has been specified for Middelgrunden which further emphasises that the proposed value of 136 dB constitutes a conservative assumption for wind power turbine. Data were linear normalized between 100 and 150 dB yearly average. More detailed information on the lineage and methodology is available and can be supplied on request to the data owner.",
    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "Attention should be paid to the underlying quality and accuracy of the sediment substrate data. In particular the Geological Survey of Sweden (SGU) provided data on the probability of occurrence of soft sediment substrates for these modelling, these data are based on both on dominant grain size and categorical maps based on hydroacoustic data. The model does not include information on sediment compaction and morphology which will certainly affect sound propagation. This model should therefore be used with caution and should not be\nused for detailed studies of smaller areas.\nThe model should be used with caution outside Sweden within HavExtend, because there\nare modelled positions for the wind power plant and because the confidence in the substrate\ndata is lower.",
    "recommendations_for_data_improvement": "s. Sound propagation models can be made considerably more complicated and \"heavy\". Modulated data has been checked against validated model for Lillgrund and there is a slight difference due to the use of generalized sound propagation factors. In the case of wind turbines, noise levels are low, which may mean that this minor error is not considered to be so important for the analysis in Symphony. Note that the noise relates only to wind turbines without masking or other effects. In reality, many other sounds occur in the ocean. If you want to develop the data set, you can develop a site-specific sound spread factor and turbine- specific source noise for each wind farm, but this is much more time-consuming and costly.",

While satellites can provide some broad-scale bathymetry or surface sediment proxies in very shallow, clear waters, the detailed, site-specific sediment characteristics and acoustic measurements required for the recommended improvements are exclusively obtained through in-situ surveys, acoustic sensors, and geotechnical sampling.

A cell value of zero is equivalent to zero nitrogen in surface waters and 100 is equivalent to 112mg/l of nitrogen (the highest recorded level). These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales.

These data were reprojected from WGS84 to ETR89 and clipped to the Symphony standard grid. Data for the Baltic and North Sea regions were merged using a transitional mask around the Oresund area. These interpolated data are inaccurate in the coastal zone and therefore a third dataset detailing modelled nitrogen levels in the coastal zone were provided by SMHI (Swedish Costal zone Model version 1.0.4, revision 512, model data 1999-2008), these data were provided with a coarse spatial resolution - mapped to polygons matching the transitional waters of the water framework directive.

In many aquatic environments, eutrophication is crucial - improvement in this would improve the quality of the model. Development of the biogeochemical components of the inshore model (as per the SCOBI model) would also be of great value - the inclusion of spatial data on drivers might also allow for improved spatial resolution in the inshore data. Any such modelling should include error levels and model validation. In general, the production of 'combined' national geodata products at source (i.e. by SMHI) would be highly valuable for national marine management objectives in Sweden. The inclusion of interpolated data with high error levels should be taken into account through the production of associated quality maps that are based on the error values presented by SMHI in their NetCDF data.",

The recommendations suggest fundamental changes like improving the eutrophication component of the SMHI coastal zone model, developing biogeochemical components for the inshore model (like SCOBI), including spatial data on drivers for improved inshore resolution, and producing associated quality maps based on error values. These are not minor refinements but require advanced modeling, new data integration, and potentially new data collection to address core inaccuracies and resolution issues.",

It involves developing and integrating advanced biogeochemical models (e.g., SCOBI-like for inshore), which requires significant scientific expertise and computational resources. Improving the eutrophication component of the SMHI coastal zone model implies complex model recalibration and validation. Including spatial data on drivers for improved inshore resolution would necessitate extensive data collection and integration. Furthermore, the recommendation for 'combined' national geodata products at source (SMHI) and the production of associated quality maps based on error values implies major coordination efforts, data infrastructure changes, and standardized data processing across different agencies and models. This goes beyond basic technical adjustments.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can be 'true' for improving this layer. While direct nitrogen concentration measurements are not typically done from space, satellite observations can provide crucial input data and validation for the models. For instance, ocean color sensors can measure chlorophyll-a, a proxy for phytoplankton biomass, which is directly related to eutrophication and nitrogen cycling. Satellite-derived water quality parameters like turbidity (suspended sediments) can also influence nitrogen dynamics and model accuracy. Land use and coastal development data from satellites can inform the 'spatial data on drivers' for the inshore model, as terrestrial runoff is a major source of nitrogen. Monitoring of algal blooms (a symptom of eutrophication) from space could also provide validation data for the model's predictions. While in-situ data remain essential, satellite data can significantly enhance the spatial and temporal resolution of model inputs and provide independent validation for the modeled nitrogen concentrations and their ecological impacts."

The source data consist of modelled water column phosphorus data in the form of NetCDF files for offshore areas and polygon shapefiles for inshore areas. Data were supplied by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. A cell value of zero is equivalent to zero\nphosphorus in surface waters and 100 is equivalent to\n2.26mg/l of phosphorus (the highest recorded level). These\ndata were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool\ndeveloped by the marine planning unit at the Swedish\nAgency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM).\nSymphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative\nenvironmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters\nand this informs the formulation of policy at plan area\nscales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only\nadvisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",

Källdata består av modellerad vattenkolumndata över fosfor i form av NetCDF-filer för havsvattenområden och polygonshape-filer för kustområden. Data tillhandahölls av Sveriges meteorologiska och hydrologiska institut (SMHI). Ett cellvärde av 0 motsvarar inget fosfor i ytvattnet, och ett cellvärde av 100 motsvarar 2.26 mg/l fosfor (högsta uppmätta nivå). Resultatet normalisrades efter värdet för God ekologisk status från EU:s havsmiljödirektiv. Denna data skapades som ett data input layer för ’Symphony’ verktyget utvecklat av enheten för havsplaneringen på Havs- och vattenmyndigheten (HaV). Symphony används av HaV för bedömning av den kumulativa miljöpåverkan av mänsklig aktivitet i svenska vatten och används vid havsplanering.

The first two were surface Phosphorus concentrations were extracted from two NetCDF files provided by SMHI: BalticSea_Water_body_Total_Phosphorus_year.nc and NorthSea_Water_body_Total_Phosphorus_year.nc. These are modelled water column data created using the DIVA interpolation tool (https://github.com/gher- ulg/DIVA) and which can be downloaded from emodnet- chemstry.eu Average annual P values for the period 2005 to 2014 were extracted from the NetCDF files for surface waters. These data were reprojected from WGS84 to ETR89 and clipped to the Symphony standard grid. Data for the Baltic and North Sea regions were merged using a transitional mask around\nthe Oresund area.\nThese interpolated data are inaccurate in the coastal zone\nand therefore a third dataset detailing modelled phosphorus\nlevels in the coastal zone were provided by SMHI (Swedish\nCostal zone Model version 1.0.4, revision 512, model data\n1999-2008), these data were provided with a coarse spatial\nresolution - mapped to polygons matching the transitional\nwaters of the water framework directive. Data are published\nhere: https://vattenweb.smhi.se\nMean average total phosphorus concentrations were\nextracted from the coastal zone model data. This annual\naverage inshore data were then merged with the offshore\ndatalayers using a mosiac function.\nThe data were then normalised on a 0-100 scale using a\nlinear rescale function.

    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "This 'annual average' dataset was created by merging data from two different temporal periods (offshore 2005-2014 and inshore 1999-2008). The inshore dataset is based on large polygon areas with very low spatial resolution yet spatial variance in phosphorus values are perhaps more likely inshore due to water column mixing caused by more complex land water interactions. For the offshore model SMHI recommend not using data with an error threshold higher than 50 percent however all data are included in this product.",
    "recommendations_for_data_improvement": "The SMHI coastal zone model is strongly influenced by the prediction of driving mechanisms and uncertainties in this. In many aquatic environments, eutrophication is crucial - improvement in this would improve the quality of the model. It is necessary to normalize data with respect to natural background levels. Development of the biogeochemical components of the inshore model (as per the SCOBI model) would also be of great value - the inclusion of spatial data on drivers might also allow for improved spatial resolution in the inshore data. Any such modelling should include error levels and model validation. In general, the production of 'combined' national geodata products at source (i.e. by SMHI) would be highly valuable for national marine management objectives in Sweden. The inclusion of interpolated data with high error levels should be taken into account through the production of associated quality maps that are based on the error values presented by SMHI in their NetCDF data.",

      "improvement_justification": "The limitations highlight significant issues: merging data from different temporal periods (offshore 2005-2014, inshore 1999-2008), very low spatial resolution for inshore data (large polygon areas), and the inclusion of offshore data with high error thresholds (up to 50%). The recommendations suggest fundamental changes like improving the prediction of driving mechanisms (eutrophication), normalizing data to natural background levels, developing biogeochemical components for the inshore model (like SCOBI), including spatial data on drivers for improved inshore resolution, and producing associated quality maps based on error values. These are not minor refinements but require substantial re-modeling, new data integration, and methodological overhauls, indicating a 'large' potential for improvement.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements would be 'high' difficulty. It involves developing advanced biogeochemical models (e.g., SCOBI-like for inshore), which requires significant scientific expertise and computational resources. Normalizing data to natural background levels is complex and requires robust baseline data. Addressing the temporal mismatch and low spatial resolution inshore data would likely necessitate new data collection campaigns or advanced interpolation/modeling techniques. The recommendation for 'combined' national geodata products at source (SMHI) implies major inter-agency coordination and data standardization efforts. Producing quality maps based on error values for all data points also adds significant complexity to the data processing pipeline. These are not simple fixes but require substantial resources, advanced technical expertise, and extensive collaboration.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can significantly help improve this layer. Phosphorus concentrations are directly linked to eutrophication, and satellite ocean color sensors can monitor proxies for eutrophication such as chlorophyll-a concentrations (phytoplankton biomass), suspended particulate matter, and water clarity. While direct phosphorus measurement from space is not feasible, the *drivers* and *effects* of phosphorus enrichment (eutrophication) are observable. Satellite data can provide high-resolution, synoptic coverage for coastal and offshore areas, addressing the 'very low spatial resolution' and 'spatial variance' issues inshore. Specifically, satellite data could: 1. Improve spatial resolution for inshore areas by providing continuous data on water quality parameters (e.g., chlorophyll-a, turbidity) that correlate with phosphorus dynamics. 2. Help validate and refine biogeochemical models by providing independent observations of eutrophication indicators. 3. Potentially aid in identifying 'driving mechanisms' by observing land-based inputs (e.g., river plumes, coastal development) or atmospheric deposition patterns. 4. Provide consistent temporal coverage to help bridge the temporal mismatch between inshore and offshore datasets, or at least provide a more current baseline for assessing changes. Therefore, satellite data can enhance the accuracy, resolution, and temporal consistency of the layer, particularly for understanding and modeling eutrophication-related phosphorus dynamics."

    "summary": "The raster layer intends to show the mean predicted catch of benthic fish by bottom trawling in Swedish coastal and offshore waters. A cell value of 0 is equivalent to no benthic fish catch by bottom trawling and a cell value of 100 is equivalent to high mean catch (SAR ≥ 8.196288). Underlying data are from two sources and consist of Surface Area Ratio (SAR) of trawling (OSPAR 2009-2013, and HELCOM 2009-2015) data. The surface area ratios (SAR) of trawling are produced by summing total swept area of trawling within a measurement area and then normalize the swept area to the measurement area. Assuming that within the measurement area the trawling is evenly distributed the surface area ratio is interpreted as the number of times per unit of time the measurement area is trawled over. The swept area for a specific fishing vessel is estimated using modelled trawl door spread (for a specific fishery/gear) multiplied by the vms (vessel monitoring system) speed and vms ping interval for a vms signal/position representing benthic trawling. The total swept area within a measurement area is then the sum of all swept area positions, from all vessels within a measurement area. For these data a linear relationship between trawl intensity SAR and catch is assumed this relationship is not modelled using logbook or landings data so this is a simplistic assumption. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",

Assuming that within the measurement area the trawling is evenly distributed the SAR is interpreted as the number of times per unit of time the measurement area is trawled over.

The total swept area within a measurement area is then the sum of all swept area positions, from all vessels within a measurement area. The underlying data has been aggregated yearly on a\ngeographic grid of resolution 0.05 degree (approximately 1.5\nx 3 nm square at 57 N). Yearly data on total SAR are\nproduced in the HELCOM (the Baltic including Kattegat)\nand OSPAR (North East Atlantic incl. Kattegat) region\nrespectively. Data are available for the years 2009 – 2013 in\nthe HELCOM region and 2009-2015 in the OSPAR region.\nData are available as spatial polygons.\nEach year’s polygon dataset were projected into the\nSymphony projection ETRS1989 LAEA. Further the\npolygons were rasterized on the symphony grid using mean\nvalues if several polygons overlay the same raster grid cell.\nAverages of SAR values are calculated (introducing zero\nvalues in NA raster cells) over the time periods (2009-2015\nfor OSPAR and 2009-2013 for HELCOM) and the Kattegat\narea where masked from the HELCOM data set. Finally the\ntwo data sets were added and save as\n'Bottom_trawling_intensity_mean_SAR.tif'\nFrom this underlying data set, representing swept area of\nbottom trawlers, a linear response proxy was derived\nrepresenting outtake of bottom fish.

      "improvement_justification": "The layer's primary limitation is the simplistic assumption of a linear relationship between trawl intensity (SAR) and catch, which is explicitly stated as 'not modelled using logbook or landings data' and potentially 'the inverse'. This fundamental flaw means the layer may not accurately represent 'mean predicted catch'. The recommendation to 'investigate the possibility of modelling the between benthic trawling effort and catch (for both Swedish and foreign fleet activity)' directly addresses this. Implementing a robust, data-driven model for catch prediction, incorporating actual logbook/landings data, would represent a substantial methodological overhaul and significantly improve the layer's accuracy and utility for marine planning, moving beyond a proxy for intensity to a more direct measure of catch.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvement of modelling the relationship between trawling effort and catch using logbook or landings data is a 'high' difficulty task. It requires access to sensitive and often proprietary logbook/landings data from both Swedish and foreign fleets, which involves significant data acquisition, harmonization, and legal/political coordination challenges. Furthermore, developing and validating a robust statistical or machine learning model to accurately predict catch from effort, considering various factors (e.g., gear type, target species, environmental conditions, stock status), is a complex data science undertaking requiring advanced expertise and computational resources. The recommendation also highlights the need for 'consistent data (temporal periods)' for OSPAR and HELCOM datasets, which implies further data harmonization efforts.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing cannot directly generate or significantly improve this layer. The core data for this layer (trawling intensity, SAR) is derived from VMS (Vessel Monitoring System) data, which tracks vessel movements and is an in-situ, transponder-based system. The proposed improvements involve integrating logbook and landings data, which are also in-situ, administrative records of fishing activity and catch. While satellites can monitor vessel presence (e.g., via AIS, though VMS is more precise for fishing activity), they cannot directly measure 'benthic fish catch' or the 'swept area' of a trawl on the seafloor, nor can they provide the detailed catch composition or quantity information found in logbooks. Therefore, the fundamental data sources and the nature of the improvements are not amenable to satellite remote sensing."

The recommendations suggest using AIS data for additional spatial information and gathering data for validation and higher resolution modeling. These improvements go beyond refining existing methods; they require integrating entirely new data streams (AIS), potentially new data collection efforts (validation data), and advanced modeling to achieve higher spatial resolution and cover significant data gaps (foreign fleets, small-scale vessels not using logbooks). This points to a substantial overhaul and expansion of the underlying data and methodology.",

Utilizing AIS data for fishing effort requires advanced data processing and interpretation, as AIS signals are not always indicative of fishing activity and require sophisticated algorithms to infer gear type and effort. Gathering validation data implies new field campaigns or access to previously uncollected data. Integrating foreign fleet activity would require international collaboration and data sharing agreements, which are often complex. Developing higher resolution models from disparate data sources (logbooks, journals, AIS, validation data) would demand advanced technical expertise in spatial modeling and data fusion. These efforts collectively require substantial resources, advanced technical expertise, and extensive data collection and coordination.",
      "satellite_justification": "While direct measurement of gillnet catch or effort from space is not possible, satellite remote sensing can indirectly contribute to improving or validating this layer. For instance, satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) could provide higher resolution seabed information, which is crucial for understanding where gillnets are deployed. Satellite observations of sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean color (chlorophyll-a) could help identify areas of high primary productivity or fish aggregation, which might correlate with fishing effort and could be used for validation or to inform predictive models of fish distribution. Furthermore, satellite-derived coastal and habitat mapping could provide context for inshore fishing grounds. While not directly generating the 'catch' data, these environmental parameters derived from satellites can offer valuable contextual information for modeling and validating the spatial distribution of fishing effort and potential catch, especially in areas where in-situ data is sparse. The recommendation to 'gather data for validation and higher resolution modelling' could leverage satellite-derived environmental data as a proxy or correlative factor."

    "lineage": "Data are from pelagic trawling and seining are used as a proxy for outtake of pelagic fish resources. Due to lack of updated and reliable data on pelagic fishery from the ICES / HELCOM data produced by ICES WGSFD and total lack of pelagic data in the available ICES / OSPAR data set, two different unofficial data sets where used to produce the pelagic fishing layer. A one year (2014) AIS derived data set on international pelagic trawlers (OTM / PTM) from the Baltic including the Kattegat area were combined with Swedish logbook data from the Skagerrak area including purse seiners (PS) and pelagic trawlers (OTM / PTM). The AIS data set represented kW*hours aggregated on a 1 km x1 km grid. The Skagerrak data used where positioned (each fishing\nevent, i.e. trawl haul is reported to degree minute precision)\nlogbook reported fishing hours multiplied with engine size.\nThe data where aggregated on a 5 km x 5 km grid and\naverages over time period 2010-2015 where produced. The\nlarger scale is due to the lower spatial resolution of the\nlogbook information compared to the AIS data used in the\nBaltic. The pelagic trawling effort in the Skagerrak where\nthen raised to total effort per ICES statistical rectangle to\naccount for Danish pelagic fishing hours using official\nnumbers of trawling effort per ICES rectangle reported by\nthe EU. This procedure excluded seining as this is mainly a\ncoastal fishery to which Danish fishermen don’t have access.\nFinally the Skagerrak layer was disaggregated to a 1 km x 1\nkm sized grid and added to the Baltic AIS layer.\nBefore normalization the OTM_1km_grid date where\ndisaggregated into the symphony grid (250 m x 250 m). The\nraster was normalized by dividing the data set by the\nmaximum trawler effort value in the Swedish exclusive\neconomic zone (EEZ):\nmaxEEZ trawler effort = 2103.768 kWh\nAfter normalizing data with maxEEZ all values >1 where set\nto 1.\nPelagic fishery outtake is assumed to be linearly proportional\nto the pelagic effort, expressed as kW*fishing hours. This\nrelationship is also assumed to be similar for seiners and\npelagic trawler.\nDespite the relatively high spatial resolution of data, the\nuncertainty of this layer is set to 0.75 representing a “bad”\nmodel, not validated.\nThe reason to place a higher uncertainty here compared to\nthe Bottom trawling is the fact that, only one year of data is\nused in the Baltic and the AIS data are not official positional\ndata (like VMS) coupled to logbook information on gear,\nmétiers etc, several gears are combined using simple\nassumptions, different scales of the underlying data are\ncombined. Also the Skagerrak data are produce based on the\ntotal fishery in the area, assuming that the Danish fishery is\nlocated exactly where the Swedish vessels operate.",
    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "In the Baltic this data links AIS records (rather than VMS) of pelagic trawl activity to Swedish logbook (landings) data. Only one year of AIS records are used (from 2014). AIS are only required to be carried on vessels over 15m (in contrast to 12m for VMS) and the activity is only linked to Swedish catch data. This is corrected in the Skaggerak where there is significant Danish fleet activity in Swedish\nwaters by utilising ICES landing data. However, these ICES catch data in contrast have a\nsignificantly lower spatial resolution.\nIn the Kattegat no spatial data are utilised other than the logbook data (60x60nm).",

      "improvement_justification": "The layer explicitly states a high uncertainty (0.75, 'bad' model, not validated) and lists several significant limitations: reliance on a single year of AIS data for the Baltic, use of AIS (not VMS) for vessels >15m, combining different data sources with varying spatial resolutions (1km vs 5km), and assumptions about Danish fleet activity. The recommendations suggest gathering data for validation and higher resolution modeling, and investigating more AIS data for the Skagerrak. Addressing these issues would require fundamental changes to data acquisition, integration, and modeling, leading to a substantial improvement in the layer's accuracy and reliability.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements would be challenging. Gathering additional years of AIS data, especially for validation, requires significant data processing and integration. Correcting for the lack of VMS data and linking AIS to logbook information for gear and métiers is complex. Harmonizing data from different sources (AIS, logbooks, ICES) with disparate spatial and temporal resolutions, and developing more sophisticated models to account for fleet activity assumptions (e.g., Danish fishery location), would require advanced technical expertise and substantial resources. The 'not planned' maintenance also suggests a lack of ongoing resources for improvement.",
      "satellite_justification": "This layer focuses on pelagic fish catch and fishing effort, which are directly measured through vessel activity data (AIS, VMS, logbooks) and landings. Satellite remote sensing cannot directly observe fish catch, fishing effort, or the specific species being targeted. While satellites can provide environmental context (e.g., sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a) that might correlate with fish distribution, they cannot generate or directly improve the core data of this layer, which is human activity (fishing) and its direct outcome (catch). The data gaps and limitations are primarily related to the collection and integration of in-situ vessel tracking and logbook data."

      "improvement_justification": "The layer explicitly states a 'simplistic assumption' of a linear relationship between trawl intensity and turbidity, which 'does not for example take into consideration benthic sediment type'. The recommendation is to 'Investigate the relationship between benthic trawling effort, sediment type and turbidity'. This requires moving beyond a simple linear proxy to a more complex, empirically validated model that incorporates environmental variables. This represents a fundamental change in methodology and data integration, moving from a proxy to a more mechanistic understanding, thus indicating large improvement potential.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvement ('Investigate the relationship between benthic trawling effort, sediment type and turbidity') would require significant effort. It involves: 1) Extensive empirical validation studies (e.g., in-situ turbidity measurements correlated with observed trawling and sediment types), which are resource-intensive. 2) Developing and validating a more sophisticated model that integrates multiple variables (trawl intensity, sediment type, potentially current dynamics, depth, etc.) beyond a simple linear relationship. 3) Potentially new data collection for sediment mapping at appropriate resolutions if existing data are insufficient. This level of research, data collection, and model development points to high difficulty.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can significantly help in generating or improving this layer, particularly concerning the 'turbidity' aspect and 'sediment type'. Ocean color sensors can provide data on Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) or turbidity in surface waters, which, while not directly 'bottom turbidity', can indicate areas of high sediment resuspension from bottom activities. This could be used for empirical validation of the model's turbidity output or to identify areas where bottom trawling might be causing significant surface turbidity plumes. Furthermore, satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) can contribute to understanding seabed characteristics, and in some cases, proxies for sediment type might be inferred from optical properties or geomorphological features visible from space, especially in shallower coastal areas. While direct 'benthic sediment type' mapping is challenging, satellite data can provide crucial contextual environmental parameters and potentially aid in validating the turbidity component of the model."

The recommendation is to determine 'The likelihood of spillage from all potentially hazardous wrecks.' This implies a fundamental need to move beyond a generalized, conservative estimate derived from only two wrecks to a more nuanced, wreck-specific assessment of spill likelihood and behavior. This would require significant new data collection (e.g., condition of individual wrecks, actual oil content, specific environmental conditions) and potentially more sophisticated modeling of oil spill dynamics beyond a simple linear decrease. This represents a substantial overhaul of the underlying methodology and data input, moving from a broad approximation to a more granular, evidence-based assessment for each wreck.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements would be 'high' difficulty. Determining the 'likelihood of spillage from all potentially hazardous wrecks' would necessitate extensive underwater surveys (e.g., ROV, AUV, divers) to assess the structural integrity, remaining oil volume, and specific characteristics of potentially thousands of shipwrecks. This is a massive undertaking requiring specialized equipment, significant vessel time, and expert personnel. Furthermore, developing more accurate spill models for each wreck, considering varying oil types, environmental conditions, and wreck integrity, would require advanced modeling expertise and computational resources. This goes far beyond 'moderate technical expertise' or 'limited new data collection'.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can significantly help improve this layer, particularly in validating and refining the 'probability of exposure' aspect. While satellite cannot directly assess the 'likelihood of spillage' from a wreck (which requires in-situ assessment of the wreck itself), it can provide crucial data for modeling the 'spread' and 'exposure' once a spill occurs. Specifically, satellite data can provide: 1. **Ocean currents and sea surface temperature:** Essential for more accurate drift modeling, moving beyond a fixed 0.2 knot drift speed. 2. **Wind speed and direction:** Crucial for refining drift models, as the current model uses a fixed 0.2 knots. 3. **Oil spill detection:** While not for predicting, satellite imagery (SAR, optical) can detect actual oil spills, which could be used for model validation and calibration if spills from wrecks were to occur. 4. **Coastal and habitat mapping:** To assess the sensitivity of areas potentially impacted by spills, improving the 'exposure' assessment. Therefore, satellite data can enhance the 'probability of exposure' calculation by providing dynamic environmental parameters and potentially aid in validating spill models, even if it cannot directly assess the wreck's condition or oil content."

This includes data from fiberbank surveys undertaken by SGU in Northern Sweden between 2010 and 2016. The impact of this limitation has been limited by incorporating an additional modelled layer into Symphony consisting of known / surveyed fiberbanks and fibre rich sediments as toxic areas (scoring 100) with a linear decrease within 10km distance however this is known to highly simplistic (in some areas there is very little heavy metal increase with distance) - it also ignores fiberbanks that have not been mapped. 2) The geostatistical interpolation method used does not take into account that land will act as a barrier. 3) The data is a historical average for all records in the ICES Dome and SGU databases and\nas such this may not reflect current sediment conditions.\n4) There is a lack of offshore samples so in general offshore areas have a much higher\nuncertainty.\n5) Data are combined based on their historical concentration and not their toxicity.",

      "improvement_justification": "The limitations highlight significant issues: missing recent data (post-2010 SGU data, unmapped fiberbanks), a simplistic model for fiberbanks, a geostatistical method that ignores land barriers, reliance on historical averages, lack of offshore samples leading to high uncertainty, and combination of data based on concentration rather than toxicity. The recommendations directly address these, suggesting an update with new data, a tool that handles land barriers, re-evaluation of temporal averaging vs. max levels, and a toxicity-based index. Implementing these would fundamentally improve the accuracy, relevance, and predictive power of the layer, moving beyond current known simplifications and data gaps, thus representing a 'large' improvement potential.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements would be 'high' difficulty. It requires integrating substantial new data (SGU post-2010, potentially new fiberbank surveys), developing or acquiring a geostatistical model capable of handling land barriers (a non-trivial task for marine environments), re-evaluating and potentially re-modeling based on different temporal approaches (e.g., max levels), and, most significantly, developing or adopting a toxicity-based index for 9 heavy metals, which would involve complex ecological and chemical modeling. This goes beyond simple data updates and involves fundamental methodological changes, requiring advanced expertise, significant resources, and potentially extensive new data collection or re-analysis of existing data for toxicity assessment.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing is 'false' for this layer. The layer focuses on predicted mean concentrations of heavy metals in marine benthic substrates (sediments). Heavy metal concentrations in sediments are primarily measured through in-situ sampling, laboratory analysis, and geostatistical interpolation of these point measurements. While satellites can detect surface water quality parameters (e.g., suspended sediments, chlorophyll, turbidity) that might indirectly correlate with some benthic conditions or pollution sources, they cannot directly measure or infer heavy metal concentrations within the sediment itself. The limitations and recommendations specifically point to issues with in-situ data availability, interpolation methods, and the need for toxicity-based indices, none of which can be directly addressed or replaced by satellite observations."

While satellite remote sensing can detect proxies for water quality (e.g., suspended sediments, chlorophyll-a, turbidity) that might be indirectly linked to pollution sources or their transport, it cannot directly measure or quantify heavy metal or organic toxin concentrations within the sediment itself. The core data needed for this layer (toxin levels in fiber banks and associated sediments) requires direct physical sampling and laboratory analysis, which satellites cannot provide."

    "summary": "This raster intends to show the predicted risk of inorganic toxin (mercury) contamination in sediments associated with licenced mercury waste dumping. In the 1960s and 1970s an estimated 23,000 barrels containing contaminated mercury waste were legally (at that time no regulation was in place) dumped in a deep water dumping site in aproximately 80m of water outside of Sundsvall in Northern Sweden. In 2006 the Geological Survey of Sweden undertook a survey of this dumping site and identified approximately 3500 barrels. This raster is modelled based on the positional data from that survey (the site and barrels in surrounding waters buffered by 1km) to provide an indication of the risk of mercury contamination. A value of 100 represents a high risk for high levels of organic and inorganic toxins in sediments and a value of 0 represents toxins at background level. Note that only 3500 barrels were found in the 2006 survey so there is uncertainty surrounding the location of the remaining barrels. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",

Under 1960- och 1970- talet dumpades uppskattningsvis 23 000 tunnor\ninnehållande förorenat kvicksilveravfall lagligt (vid denna\ntidpunkt fanns ingen reglering av dumpning) i ett\ndjupvattensområde på ungefär 80 meters djup utanför\nSundsvall i norra Sverige. Under 2006 genomförde Sveriges\ngeologiska undersökning (SGU) en undersökning av detta\ndumpningsområde och identifierade uppskattningsvis 3500\ntunnor. Detta rasterskikt är modellerat baserat på\npositionsdata från undersökningen (plats och tunnor i\nomgivande vatten i en buffertzon av 1 km) för att ge en\nindikation på risken för kvicksilverförorening. Ett värde av\n100 motsvarar hög risk för höga nivåer av organiska och\noorganiska miljögifter i sediment, och ett värde av 0\nmotsvarar miljögifter på bakgrundsnivå. Observera att\nendast 3500 tunnor återfanns under undersökningen från\n2006, så osäkerhet finns angående position av återstående\ntunnor.

The recommendation is to 'undertake additional surveys to gather more data'. This indicates a fundamental data gap that requires extensive new data collection to substantially improve the accuracy and completeness of the risk assessment, moving beyond a 'simplistic model'.",

It would require specialized vessels, advanced acoustic or ROV/AUV technology, extensive survey time, and significant financial investment, classifying it as 'high' difficulty.",
      "satellite_justification": "The core problem is the precise location of submerged mercury barrels and the resulting sediment contamination. Satellite remote sensing cannot penetrate water to 80m depth to detect individual barrels or directly measure heavy metal concentrations in sediments. While satellites can monitor surface water quality, this layer is specifically about benthic contamination from dumped barrels. Therefore, in-situ measurements, acoustic surveys, and sediment sampling are indispensable and cannot be effectively replaced or supplemented by satellite observations for this specific problem."

The current approach is a placeholder, suggesting significant room for improvement in accuracy and scientific rigor.",

Satellite remote sensing primarily observes surface phenomena (e.g., water quality, temperature, surface currents, coastal changes). While some satellite data (e.g., suspended sediments) might indirectly indicate disturbance, they cannot directly measure or infer the presence and concentration of heavy metals within the seabed sediments. Direct measurement of sediment contamination requires in-situ sampling and laboratory analysis, which are not achievable via satellite."

The underlying data was sourced from HELCOM in the form of point, line and polygon shapefiles detailing the location of dumping grounds, risk areas and dredged munitions. The dataset is modelled using a simplistic assumption of decreasing risk with distance from the dump sites. value of 100 represents a high risk for high levels of organic and inorganic toxins in sediments and a value of 0 represents toxins at background level. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales.

A value of 0 is equivalent to a mean concentration of 0 for the 32 organic toxins and a value of 1 is equivalent to mean very high concentrations (Class 5, Naturvårdsverket rapport 4914). The data has been normalised to the likelihood of mud content in surrounding sediments based on the assumption that organic toxins will bind with organic matter in sediment. Outliers have been modelled separately and reintroduced into the dataset. These areas all have recorded organic toxin concentrations at levels significantly above the very-high level and are mapped with a buffer of approximately 15km based on the assumption that proximity to these sites equates to a higher risk of organic toxin pollution. This raster is based on historical sediment data from the Geological Survey of Sweden and International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales.

SGU data imported from the national sediment data archive (including data from national monitoring by SGU, regional and local monitoring by County Administrations, the Swedish EPA and SWAM and from historical ad-hoc surveys undertaken by SGU (including some commercial data).

    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "There are a number of key limitations users should be aware of when using this dataset: 1) Data collected by SGU after 2010 were not available to be included in this model. This includes data from fiberbank surveys undertaken by SGU in Northern Sweden between 2010 and 2016. The impact of this limitation has been limited by incorporating an additional modelled layer into Symphony consisting of known / surveyed fiberbanks and fibre rich sediments as toxic areas (scoring 100) with a linear decrease within 10km distance however this is known to highly simplistic (in some areas there is very little heavy metal increase with distance) - it\nalso ignores fiberbanks that have not been mapped.\n2) The geostatistical interpolation method used does not take into account that land will act\nas a barrier.\n3) The data is a historical average for all records in the ICES Dome and SGU databases and\nas such this may not reflect current sediment conditions.\n4) There is a lack of offshore samples so in general offshore areas have a much higher\nuncertainty.\n5) Data are combined based on their historical concentration and not their toxicity.",

      "improvement_justification": "The layer has 'large' improvement potential due to several fundamental limitations and recommendations. The model relies on historical data (1984-2014) which 'may not reflect current sediment conditions', suggesting a need for more contemporary data. The 'lack of offshore samples' leads to 'much higher uncertainty' in offshore areas, indicating significant data gaps. The geostatistical interpolation method 'does not take into account that land will act as a barrier', which is a major methodological flaw for coastal areas. Furthermore, the data is based on 'historical concentration and not their toxicity', implying a need for a more ecologically relevant index. The recommendation to 'produce an update to this model with data from SGU post 2010' and 'determine if a toxicity based index is more appropriate' points to substantial improvements beyond minor refinements. Addressing these issues would require significant data acquisition, methodological overhauls, and potentially new modeling approaches.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements would be 'high' difficulty. Updating the model with SGU data post-2010 requires significant data acquisition and integration, especially given the previous data processing steps. Modeling with a tool that 'can handle land as a barrier' implies a shift to more sophisticated geostatistical or spatial modeling techniques, which can be computationally intensive and require specialized expertise. Determining a 'specific time frame' or 'max level' for data, or developing a 'toxicity based index', would involve extensive research, data analysis, and potentially new scientific consensus. The 'lack of offshore samples' suggests a need for new, targeted sampling campaigns, which are costly and resource-intensive in marine environments. These changes collectively demand advanced technical expertise, substantial new data collection, and potentially major infrastructure changes in data processing and modeling capabilities.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing is 'false' for directly generating or significantly improving this layer. The layer focuses on 'organic toxins in marine benthic substrates' (sediments). Satellite remote sensing primarily observes surface phenomena (e.g., sea surface temperature, ocean color, suspended sediments in the water column, land use). While some satellite data (e.g., land use/coastal development) might indirectly inform potential sources of pollution, they cannot directly measure or infer the concentration of specific organic toxins within benthic sediments. The data relies on 'historical sediment data' and 'in-situ' measurements from databases (Geological Survey of Sweden, ICES Dome). The limitations and recommendations also point to issues like 'lack of offshore samples' (requiring physical sampling), 'geostatistical interpolation' (a modeling technique), and 'toxicity based index' (requiring chemical analysis), none of which are directly addressed or significantly enhanced by current satellite remote sensing capabilities for benthic toxin concentrations."

    "lineage": "This dataset was created using point data showing harbours which were sourced from Helcom and which in turn are based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, the Baltic Port List 2012, and maps available in Port's official websites. The derived dataset was created based on the following process: 1. Ports inside Symphony land boundary were moved to the coastline using a nearest neighbour join. 2. All sites within the marine area were selected and a 1000 buffer was applied. 3. A value of 100 was applied to the buffer polygons. 4. The data were converted to a raster and with the Symphony grid specification.",
    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "The 1000 buffer this is a simplistic risk estimate. There is no definition of what constitutes a 'harbour' in this dataset and at present this dataset does not include small scale docks (brygga) which might constitute a cumulative impact similar (or larger) than small harbours.",
    "recommendations_for_data_improvement": "Define what a 'habour' means. Scale habours based on size. Develop a clear rationale for applying any buffer. Represent larger harbours as buffered polygon features rather than buffered points (they are much larger areas). Use a graduated reduction in impact risk with distance (rather than a binary high/no impact. Gather empirical data and information (e.g. from SEPA/County Admin monitoring) which can be used to develop and validate a better model of spatial risk of organic toxin pollution. Gather attribute information on for example the area, number of vessel berths, type of shipping etc that could be used to modify the risk levels) and environmental criteria such as data on currents / sediments to model risk depending on site location.",

      "improvement_justification": "The limitations and recommendations highlight fundamental issues with the layer's methodology and data. The current approach is a 'simplistic risk estimate' with a binary buffer, no clear definition of 'harbour', and exclusion of significant potential contributors (small docks). Recommendations include defining 'harbour', scaling by size, developing a clear rationale for buffers, using graduated risk, gathering empirical data for validation, and incorporating attribute information (e.g., vessel berths, shipping type) and environmental criteria (currents, sediments). These changes represent a complete overhaul of the risk model, moving from a simple proximity-based binary assessment to a nuanced, data-driven, and spatially variable risk model, indicating a 'large' potential for improvement.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements would be 'high' difficulty. It requires defining and standardizing 'harbour' classifications, which can be complex. Scaling harbours by size and type necessitates new data collection or integration of existing, potentially disparate, datasets (e.g., port authority data, AIS for vessel traffic). Developing a 'clear rationale for applying any buffer' and a 'graduated reduction in impact risk' requires advanced modeling and potentially new research into toxin dispersion. Gathering 'empirical data and information (e.g., from SEPA/County Admin monitoring)' for validation is a significant undertaking, involving data acquisition from multiple agencies, data harmonization, and potentially new monitoring programs. Incorporating 'attribute information' and 'environmental criteria such as data on currents / sediments' requires integrating diverse geospatial and temporal datasets, advanced spatial analysis, and potentially hydrodynamic modeling. These tasks involve significant resources, advanced technical expertise, extensive data collection, and major inter-agency collaboration.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can significantly help improve this layer. While direct measurement of synthetic toxins is not typically done by satellite, several recommended improvements can leverage satellite data: \n1. **Coastal and Habitat Mapping / Land Use and Coastal Development:** Satellite imagery can help in defining and mapping 'harbours' more accurately, especially larger ones, and identifying coastal infrastructure. It can also assist in identifying small-scale docks (brygga) that are currently excluded, by analyzing high-resolution imagery for coastal development patterns. \n2. **Sea Surface Temperature and Currents:** Satellite-derived sea surface temperature and current data (e.g., from altimetry or ocean color sensors for proxies) can inform hydrodynamic models to better represent 'currents' and 'sediments' movement, which are crucial for modeling toxin dispersion and 'graduated reduction in impact risk with distance'. \n3. **Suspended Sediments / Water Quality Indicators:** Satellite observations of suspended sediments or other water quality parameters (e.g., turbidity, chlorophyll-a as an indicator of ecosystem health) could potentially be used as proxies or validation data for areas of higher impact, especially if toxins are associated with particulate matter. \n4. **AIS Data (indirectly via satellite reception):** While the lineage mentions AIS data, satellite-based AIS reception is a growing field that could provide more comprehensive vessel traffic data, aiding in 'scaling harbours based on size' and 'type of shipping' for risk assessment. \nTherefore, satellite data can contribute to better spatial definition, environmental context, and potentially validation of the improved risk model."

Satellite-derived currents (from altimetry or ocean color) can inform the 'environmental criteria (such as data on currents)' recommended for modifying risk levels. Land use and coastal development data from satellites can help identify potential upstream industrial areas or changes in land cover that might influence runoff. While not directly measuring toxins, these satellite observations can provide critical contextual data for developing and validating a more sophisticated spatial risk model and understanding the environmental fate and transport of potential pollutants."

      "improvement_justification": "The limitations explicitly state 'No information is included which details the sediment type or volume of material extracted and the precise location of material removed.' The recommendations suggest 'Gather more precise footprint information on the location and volume of aggregates extracted that can be included as source data attribution. These data would allow impact scaling.' This indicates a fundamental lack of detailed operational data, moving beyond just licensed areas to actual extraction footprints and volumes. This requires new data collection and advanced modeling to move from a binary 'risk' based on licensed areas to a scaled 'impact' based on actual activity, representing a substantial improvement.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommendations ('Gather more precise footprint information on the location and volume of aggregates extracted') would require significant resources and advanced technical expertise. It would likely involve establishing new data collection protocols with mining operators, potentially requiring in-situ monitoring, detailed operational logs, or advanced acoustic/bathymetric surveys to map precise extraction locations and volumes. This goes beyond simple data integration and implies a major effort in data acquisition and potentially regulatory changes to mandate such reporting.",
      "satellite_justification": "The core limitations and recommendations revolve around the 'precise location of material removed' and 'volume of material extracted' for sand and gravel mining. While satellite remote sensing can detect changes in coastal morphology or suspended sediment plumes (which might be associated with dredging), it cannot directly provide the precise footprint of sub-surface extraction or the volume of material removed from a specific site. These data points require in-situ measurements, operational logs from the mining companies, or high-resolution bathymetric surveys, which are not typically derived from satellite observations. Satellite-derived bathymetry has limitations in turbid waters and for detecting fine-scale changes in already deep areas where sand extraction might occur."

      "improvement_justification": "The current model makes a simplistic assumption of high impact (100) within the licensed site and no impact elsewhere, which is explicitly stated as likely overestimating the spatial footprint of impact. The limitations highlight the lack of consideration for current influence on sediment dispersal, sediment type, volume, and precise location of extraction. The recommendations directly address these by suggesting inclusion of dominant current strength/direction, and if available, sediment type, volume, and location. Implementing these would fundamentally change the spatial impact model from a binary 'on/off' within a polygon to a more nuanced, spatially distributed impact, representing a substantial improvement in accuracy and realism.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements involves integrating new data sources (currents, potentially sediment type/volume/location), which are stated as publicly available (SMHI, Balance project). This requires advanced modeling capabilities to incorporate current dynamics into sediment dispersal, moving beyond a simple polygon-based impact. While data sources are identified, the integration and modeling effort would require advanced technical expertise and potentially collaboration with data providers, placing it in the 'medium' difficulty category rather than 'low' which implies basic coordination.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can significantly help improve this layer. Specifically, satellite-derived data on suspended sediments (water quality parameters) can be used to validate or even directly map the actual spatial extent and intensity of turbidity plumes caused by sand extraction, which is the core impact this layer aims to represent. While the layer is about 'turbidity sand extraction', the current model doesn't actually model turbidity. Satellite data can provide direct observations of turbidity. Furthermore, satellite-derived current data (e.g., from altimetry or ocean color features) could potentially supplement or validate in-situ current data used for dispersal modeling. Coastal and habitat mapping from satellites could also help assess the ecological impact of these turbidity plumes on sensitive habitats."

    "summary": "This raster intends to show the intensity of bird hunting in Swedish coastal and offshore waters. The source data details statistics for two bird species (the Common Eider, Goldeneye) killed in various regions in 2015 in the form of an excel spreadsheet. This data was combined with spatial data for coastal regions assuming hunting occurs all the way to the edge of the territorial limits and these spatial data were used to transform the data to number of individuals killed per hectare. The data were adjusted to be proportional to the whole population for each species, then aggregated and transformed. A cell value of zero represents no individual birds hunted and a cell value of 100 represents the equivalent of 0.001 individuals killed per hectare. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",

Denna data kombinerades med rumslig data för kustregioner och gör antagandet att jakt förekommer hela vägen ut till territorialhavets gräns, och dessa rumsliga data användes för att transformera data till antal individer skjutna per hektar. Data justerades för att bli proportionell till hela populationen för varje art, sedan aggregerad och\ntransformerad.\nEtt cellvärde av 0 motsvarar inga enskilda fåglar skjutna, och\nett cellvärde av 100 motsvarar 0,001 enskilda fåglar skjutna\nper hektar.\nDetta data skapades som ett data input layer för ’Symphony’\nverktyget utvecklat av enheten för havsplaneringen på Havs-\noch vattenmyndigheten (HaV).

Bird hunting data for two species (Eider and Knipa) were downloaded from the Swedish Hunting Association's website: https://rapport.viltdata.se and detail hunting activity for 2015. Boundaries data are open data (overview maps) downloaded from the Swedish land registration authority (Lantmäteriet). The data were normalised to the 2015 national population level for each species determined by the 2016 report \"ORNIS SVECICA 26:3–54, 2016\" thereby producing a proportion of the national population depleted by hunting activity. The species data were applied to the boundary polygons from Lantmäteriet according to the location described in the hunting data. The surface area of the polygons was determined using geometry calculator and the normalised value for hunting was divided by the surface area of the relevant polygon in order to produce a proportion of the population killed per hectare. A linear min-max stretch was then applied to these normalised data and based on a 0-100 scale.

      "improvement_justification": "The layer has fundamental limitations, including reliance on voluntarily transmitted AIS B data (leading to significant underestimation of traffic), an assumed linear relationship between activity and pollution (without actual pollution estimation), and exclusion of traffic far from the coast. Addressing these requires new data collection (e.g., validating AIS B coverage, collecting actual pollution data), advanced modeling to establish non-linear relationships, and potentially incorporating broader traffic patterns. The 'expert assessment' element also suggests a need for more robust, data-driven methodologies.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements and addressing the limitations would be challenging. Validating AIS B coverage against external observations (SAR, insurance reports) requires significant data acquisition and cross-referencing. Establishing a validated link between recreational vessel activity and actual pollution impacts necessitates extensive environmental monitoring and scientific studies, which are resource-intensive. Extending AIS data over a longer period and integrating it with other data sources (e.g., port data, non-AIS vessel movements) requires advanced data processing and potentially new data collection infrastructure. The need to move beyond a simple linear assumption to actual pollution estimation implies complex modeling and environmental chemistry expertise.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can significantly contribute to improving this layer. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data can be used to detect vessels, including those not transmitting AIS, thereby helping to validate and correct the underestimation of recreational boat traffic (as explicitly recommended). While direct 'pollution' from recreational boating (e.g., microplastics, fuel leaks) is hard to quantify directly from space, satellite-derived water quality parameters (e.g., turbidity, chlorophyll-a as indicators of eutrophication, or even potential oil slicks from spills) could indirectly help in validating or understanding the environmental impact in areas of high boating activity. Coastal mapping from satellites could also help refine the 'harbour' and 'distance to coast' classifications. Therefore, satellite data offers a crucial avenue for both traffic validation and potential environmental impact assessment."

Key issues include the reliance on 2009 AIS B data (which is voluntary and likely a significant underestimate), the exclusion of recreational boat traffic far from the coast, and the assumption of a linear relationship between activity and noise without actual noise level estimation. The recommendations explicitly call for using AIS data over a longer period, validating AIS B vessel numbers (potentially with external observations), and finding data/studies to validate the activity-noise link.

Obtaining AIS data over a longer time period and ensuring its quality requires significant data management and processing. Validating AIS B vessel numbers using external observations (like SAR satellite data or insurance reports) involves integrating disparate datasets and potentially developing new validation methodologies. Most critically, establishing and validating the link between recreational vessel activity and actual noise impacts would require extensive acoustic data collection, potentially new modeling approaches, and interdisciplinary expertise (acoustics, marine biology, vessel dynamics). This goes beyond simple data refinement and involves substantial resources, advanced technical expertise, and extensive data collection efforts.",

Specifically, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data can be used to detect vessels, including recreational boats, regardless of whether they transmit AIS B signals. This directly addresses the limitation of the 'significant underestimate' of recreational boat traffic due to the voluntary nature of AIS B. SAR data could help validate the number of vessels carrying AIS B beacons and potentially provide a more comprehensive picture of vessel density, especially in areas where AIS B coverage is sparse or non-existent. While satellite data cannot directly measure underwater noise, it can provide crucial input for more accurate vessel activity mapping, which is a prerequisite for better noise modeling."

The dataset is modelled and is based on combined annual 2015 AIS shipping intensity and depth data from the Swedish Maritime Administration and the probability of soft bottom substrate occurrence from the Geological Survey of Sweden. The data is based on a range of simplifications and assumptions which will introduce errors and uncertainty into the data product. The model is not validated however observational data in the form of publically available multibeam survey data in harbour areas predicted to have high levels of erosion around Skåne in southern Sweden does provide some data to support the model prediction in heavy traffic areas. These data were created as a data input layer\nfor 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit\nat the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management\n(SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the\ncumulative environmental impact of human activity in\nSwedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at\nplan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is\nonly advisable with the guidance and advice of the data\nsources.",

Detta rasterskikt är modellerat och är baserat på kombinerat årlig AIS data (2015), djupdata från Sjöfartsverket och data över trolig förekomst av mjukbottnar från Sveriges geologiska undersökning. Denna data är baserad på en rad förenklingar och antaganden vilket ger felkällor och osäkerhet. Modellen är inte validerad, dock finns observationsdata i form av offentligt tillgänglig mulitbeam- data från undersökningar i hamnområden som förutspås ha höga nivåer av erosion runt Skåne i södra Sverige, vilket ger viss data som stöd till modellen i tungt trafikerade områden. Denna data skapades som ett data input layer för ’Symphony’ verktyget utvecklat av enheten för havsplaneringen på Havs- och vattenmyndigheten (HaV). Symphony används av HaV för bedömning av den kumulativa miljöpåverkan av mänsklig aktivitet i svenska vatten och används vid havsplanering.

    "lineage": "The dataset is based on combined annual 2015 AIS vessel tracking data created by WSP for SWaM's Symphony project. Calculation of induced flow rate at the bottom is based on [Fuehrer M. and Romisch K. 1987. Propeller jet erosion and stability criteria for bottom protection of various constructions. PIANC, Bulletin No. 58.] Erosion has been assumed to occur at current velocities> = 0.3 m / s. Above the critical erosion level (0.3 m / s), erosion has been assumed linearly following the increasing induced flow velocity (closer to deeper propellers). Furthermore, a simplified assumption has been made where erosion increases linearly to the soft bottom / transport bottom portion within each cell of 250 x 250 m. Also, erosion increases linearly to the annual vessel frequency within each corresponding cell. Processing steps are as follows: 1. The combined proportion of the transport base and\nsoftbottom was calculated from the SGU basis\nSUBSTRATKARTOR_V1_SYMPHONY_20160919.\n2. AIS data on the vessel classes of tankers, passenger ships,\ncargo vessels in 2015 were pooled into one layer with the\ntotal vessel intensity per 250 x 250 m grid cell.\n3. Max speed (Vdmax) at a certain depth (d) was calculated\nwith the equation Vdmax = 10.565 * d-1. Where depth values\nwere collected from SGU\nDJUP_SYMPHONY_V2_20160919.\n4: The equation is based on a power function matched to the\nresults of calculations of Vdmax using the relationship set by\nFuehrer & Romisch (Fuehrer M. and Romisch K. 1987.\nPropeller jet erosion and stability criteria for bottom\nprotection of various constructions. PIANC, Bulletin No.\n58.).\nWhen calculating Vdmax, a standard vessel has been used\nfor which the following assumptions have been made:\nPropeller diameter: 7.5 m (no rudder).,Propeller location:\n4.15 m below water level, Rotation speed: 80 rpm\n(equivalent to about 14.5 knots), Vessel size: L 330 m, W\n50m, D 15 m, E (constant): 0.21 (applicable to ships without\nrudders), Thrust coefficient: 0.45 (chart for advance no J\n0.45) (MAN, Basic Principles of Ship Propulsion)\nAccording to Hjulströms diagram, flow rates above 5 m / s\ncan move all types of sediments (up to blocks). Values above\n5 m / s are not relevant why a threshold was applied at 5 m /\ns (all values above the threshold were given value 5 m / s.\nErosion on semi-finite sediment bottoms can occur at\ninduced current velocities of about 0.3 m / s (wheel flow\ndiagram), why a lower threshold was placed at this flow rate.\n4. All components in the model affect the degree of erosion\nof bottom sediment, i.e.: intensity of vessel traffic,\nproportion of fine / half-sediment and deep-specific\npotential flow rate were pooled by multiplying.\n5. The final grid was normalized linearly between min 0 and\nmax 100\n\"",
    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "The model is constructed to predict vessel thrust velocities that are likely to cause erosion and this calculation is based on a set of simple assumptions. The first is that all vessels have the same characteristics, the second, that erosion is assumed to occur at current velocities> = 0.3 m / s. Thirdly, that above the critical erosion level (0.3 m / s), erosion linearly decreases with depth (i.e. increasing induced flow velocity closer to deeper propellers). Furthermore,\na simplified assumption has been made whereby erosion increases as the probability of soft\nbottom substrate increases and erosion increases linearly to the annual vessel frequency\nwithin each corresponding cell.\nThe substrate and depth datasets used are also subject to limitations which should be\ninvestigated in further detail.",
    "recommendations_for_data_improvement": "The model could be further refined by adding addition criteria on vessel dimensions. Additional observational data could be collected to validate the model assumptions. The substrate dataset could be refined (for example consideration of the morphology of the substrate and compaction of sediments). Data on currents and exposure could be introduced (however it is assumed that the sediment data would be collinear). A more advanced form of modelling based (e.g. a GAM) might prove a different relationship between the different variables so this might be valuable to test.",

      "improvement_justification": "The layer has 'large' improvement potential due to fundamental simplifications and assumptions in the model, as explicitly stated in the limitations. These include assuming all vessels have the same characteristics, a linear decrease of erosion with depth, and linear relationships with soft bottom probability and vessel frequency. The recommendations suggest significant methodological changes like adding vessel dimensions, collecting extensive observational data for validation, refining substrate data (morphology, compaction), introducing currents and exposure, and exploring advanced modeling (e.g., GAM). These are not minor refinements but rather address core model deficiencies and data inputs, indicating a high potential for substantial improvement in accuracy and realism.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements would be 'high' difficulty. It requires advanced technical expertise for developing and validating a more complex model (e.g., GAM) that accounts for non-linear relationships and multiple variables. Extensive new data collection is needed for vessel-specific characteristics, detailed observational erosion data for validation, and refined substrate properties (morphology, compaction). Integrating data on currents and exposure, which are dynamic, adds further complexity. This level of refinement and validation would involve significant resources, potentially new sensor deployments, and advanced data processing capabilities.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing can 'true' help improve this layer, particularly in addressing the limitations related to substrate and potentially validating aspects of the model. While direct erosion measurement is difficult, satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) could refine depth data, especially in shallower coastal areas, and potentially contribute to understanding substrate morphology if combined with other data. More importantly, satellite observations of suspended sediments (turbidity) could provide valuable observational data for validating the model's predictions of erosion-induced turbidity, especially in high-traffic areas. Although not directly measuring erosion, changes in turbidity patterns observed from space could serve as an indicator of the model's accuracy regarding sediment resuspension. Furthermore, satellite data on coastal development and land use could indirectly inform areas of potential sediment input or altered hydrodynamics relevant to erosion."

    "summary": "This raster intends to show predicted sound level exposure at a frequency of 125 Hertz from shipping (i.e. passenger, cargo, and tanker) in Swedish coastal and offshore waters. A cell value of 0 is equivalent to low exposure (<100 dB re 1 uPa) and a cell value of 100 is equivalent to high exposure (>150 dB re 1 uPa). Underlying data are from several sources and consist of shipping traffic data, bottom substrate data, and depth data that have been combined and modelled. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",

    "lineage": "With the assistance of a generalised spreading model (RL = SL – TL) the Received Level (RL) of sound was calculated for all cells in the SYMPHONY area at two frequencies (125 Hz and 2000 Hz). SL = Source level. Transmission loss (TL) was calculated as a function of the distance from the source (distance) as well as bottom substrate character at the source. For shallow (<30m) bottoms with hard sediment character the function 15 × log(distance) was used and for deep (>30m) bottom or soft sediment character the function 20 × log(distance) was used. Bottom substrate classification was based on maps of bottom substrate purpose produced by the Geological Survey of Sweden (SGU) for SYMPHONY. Bottom substrates where the proportion of soft bottom was > 50% were defined as having soft sediment character. The aggregated sound from all ships within a particular ship class over a year were combined and converted to sound intensity. The yearly average was calculated and then converted to sound volume expressed in average decibels (dBavg), which was calculated as follows: dBavg = 10 × log10(∑∆t/T×(10)^((RL intensity/10)) summed over all ∆t under the whole time period T (1 year alternatively 6 months). Source sound volumes that were applied for different ship classes were as follows: 125 Hz Passenger ships – 150 dB 125 Hz Cargo ships – 180 dB 125 Hz Tanker ships – 185 dB 2000 Hz Passenger ships – 150 dB 2000 Hz Cargo ships – 153 dB 2000 Hz Tanker ships – 160 dB Data were linear normalized between 100 and 150 dB yearly average. Schematic source strengths for different ship types and frequency ranges have been determined by a literature study. In cases where source strengths of 1/3 octave band at 125 and 2000 Hz have not been identified, the closest value\nfound in the literature is used.\nMore detailed information on the lineage and methodology\nis available and can be supplied on request to the data\nowner.",

      "improvement_justification": "The limitations explicitly state that the generalized sound propagation model is not externally validated and should be interpreted with caution. It also highlights issues with the underlying quality and accuracy of sediment substrate data, specifically mentioning that the model does not include information on sediment compaction and morphology, which significantly affect sound propagation. The recommendations suggest producing data on seabed geomorphology (e.g., depth metrics) and sediment compaction, and identifying additional sources of acoustic monitoring data for validation. Addressing these fundamental issues (model validation, incorporating critical physical properties like sediment compaction/morphology, and acquiring new acoustic monitoring data) represents a substantial overhaul and addition of new data streams, indicating a 'large' potential for improvement.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements would be 'high' difficulty. External validation of a sound propagation model requires extensive in-situ acoustic monitoring data, which is explicitly stated as 'little data is available' and 'identification of additional sources' is needed. This implies significant new data collection efforts, potentially involving deploying hydrophones and conducting controlled sound source experiments. Producing data on seabed geomorphology and sediment compaction at a regional scale is also a substantial undertaking, requiring specialized surveys (e.g., seismic, core sampling). These efforts involve significant resources, advanced technical expertise in acoustics and marine geology, and extensive data collection, aligning with the 'high' difficulty criteria.",
      "satellite_justification": "Satellite remote sensing cannot directly generate or significantly improve this layer. The core data gaps and limitations relate to in-situ acoustic sound propagation measurements, detailed seabed sediment compaction, and morphology. While satellite-derived bathymetry can provide depth data, the model already uses depth data, and the critical missing components are sediment compaction and morphology, which satellites cannot directly measure. Similarly, satellite observations cannot provide the necessary acoustic monitoring data for model validation. The layer's focus on underwater sound propagation and seabed physical properties at a fine scale necessitates in-situ measurements and acoustic data, which are beyond current satellite capabilities."

Identifying and integrating 'additional sources of acoustic monitoring data' for validation implies a need for a comprehensive acoustic monitoring network or significant data sharing agreements, which can be complex and costly.

The primary limitations relate to the lack of external validation for the sound propagation model, the absence of sediment compaction and detailed geomorphology data, and the need for acoustic monitoring data. While satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) can provide depth data in clear, shallow waters, it typically lacks the resolution and accuracy for detailed seabed geomorphology (e.g., fine-scale rugosity, sediment type beyond broad classifications) and cannot provide information on sediment compaction. Acoustic monitoring data, which is crucial for model validation, is inherently an in-situ measurement. Therefore, the critical data needed for improvement (detailed seabed properties, acoustic validation data) are not directly observable or derivable from current satellite capabilities."

A cell\nvalue of 0 is equivalent to low probability of exposure and a\ncell value of 100 is equivalent to a high probability of\nexposure. Underlying data are from two sources and consist\nof shipping traffic data (AIS 2015) and illegal oil discharge\ndata (HELCOM, 2015) that have been combined and\nmodelled. These data were created as a data input layer for\n'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at\nthe Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management\n(SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the\ncumulative environmental impact of human activity in\nSwedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at\nplan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is\nonly advisable with the guidance and advice of the data\nsources.",

Ett cellvärde av 0 motsvarar låg sannolikhet för oljespill, och ett cellvärde av 100 motsvarar hög sannolikhet. Underlagsdata härrör från två källor och består av trafikdata (AIS, 2015) och data över illegala oljeutsläpp (HELCOM, 2015) som har kombinerats och modellerats. Denna data skapades som ett data input layer för ’Symphony’ verktyget utvecklat av enheten för havsplaneringen på Havs- och vattenmyndigheten (HaV). Symphony används av HaV för bedömning av den kumulativa miljöpåverkan av mänsklig aktivitet i svenska vatten och används vid havsplanering. Återanvändning av denna data för andra ändamål är endast lämpligt efter vägledning och rådgivning av datakällorna.",
    "lineage": "Based on data of ship traffic (AIS 2015) and detected oil spills (HELCOM, 2015, http://helcom.fi/baltic-sea- trends/data-maps/) the likelihood that an oil spill would occur in an area with a certain level of ship traffic intensity was established. The likelihood of an oil spill was calculated for 10 classes of ship traffic intensity. A focal statistics filter was applied on the generated raster to simulate areas that could be impacted by a spill. The impact area was estimated for an oil spill with a residence time of 24 h and a spreading distance equivalent to the distance that a spill can travel with a speed of 0.2 or 0.5 knots (i.e. two spreading scenarios with wind speeds of approx. 4.5 m/s and 8.5 m/s, in accordance with the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute’s (SMHI) report 2007-8, Fairways in the Baltic Sea, Oil spill risk assessment). A sensitivity analysis was undertaken whereby detected spills moved a distance equivalent to that of the drift speed under 12h in a random direction. The sensitivity analysis indicated high sensitivity for the spills reported location. To simulate the oil spill weathering (i.e.\ndissolution, dilution, dispersion, sedimentation and\nevaporation) a linear decrease with respect to increasing\ndistance from the source cell was applied. Discussion on the\nmethod occurred between WSP (consultant) and SwAM\n(client) as well as Linnaeus University (expert).",
    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "The model used requires a connection between vessel intensity and likelihood of an oil spill but there are a number of other explanatory factors with great or greater relevance with are currently omitted. The sensitivity analysis indicated high sensitivity to the spill's reported location. The spill may have moved in the period between occurrence of the spill to the Coast Guard's discovery which introduces major uncertainties in the model. Data on seabirds killed by oil spills indicates that the actual amount of spills that are happening are likely to be greater than reported. This gives further uncertainty and implies that the model probably underestimates the likelihood. The probability that a spill enters the surrounding grid cell has been calculated by assuming a linear decrease with probability 0 at the distance reached during 24 h with a wind speed of 0.2 knots. The results should be interpreted as standard estimates.",
    "recommendations_for_data_improvement": "There are insufficient data on actual spill occurrences so the model results should be interpreted with caution. These model could be significantly improved with higher rates of detection. It is unclear if reporting to the maritime authority is based on real time satellite data. Surface Aperture Radar (SAR) equipped satellite sensors are becoming increasingly capable of detecting spills. Further investigations should be undertaken to identify potential data gathering opportunities.",

    "improvement_reasoning": {
      "improvement_justification": "The layer explicitly states that the model 'probably underestimates the likelihood' of oil spills due to insufficient data on actual occurrences and issues with reported spill locations. It also notes the omission of 'other explanatory factors with great or greater relevance'. The recommendations directly call for 'higher rates of detection' and 'further investigations to identify potential data gathering opportunities'. Addressing these fundamental data gaps and incorporating additional relevant factors would lead to a substantial improvement in the accuracy and reliability of the probability estimates, moving beyond 'standard estimates' to a more robust model. This goes beyond minor refinements and requires significant data acquisition and potentially re-evaluation of the underlying model assumptions.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements, particularly achieving 'higher rates of detection' and integrating real-time satellite data, involves 'advanced technical expertise' (e.g., processing SAR data, developing robust detection algorithms) and 'substantial new data collection' (continuous satellite monitoring, improved ground-truthing). While not requiring 'major infrastructure changes' on the scale of building new satellites, it does necessitate significant investment in data acquisition, processing capabilities, and potentially 'collaboration across multiple organizations' (e.g., Coast Guard, satellite data providers, research institutions) to integrate new data streams and refine the model. The sensitivity analysis indicating high sensitivity to reported location also suggests a need for more precise and timely spill localization, which can be technically challenging.",
      "satellite_justification": "The recommendations explicitly mention that 'Surface Aperture Radar (SAR) equipped satellite sensors are becoming increasingly capable of detecting spills' and suggest investigating if 'reporting to the maritime authority is based on real time satellite data'. This directly points to satellite remote sensing as a key technology for improving the layer. SAR satellites can detect oil slicks on the ocean surface, providing crucial data on actual spill occurrences, their locations, and potentially their extent, which directly addresses the current 'insufficient data on actual spill occurrences' and the 'sensitivity to the spill's reported location'. This would allow for a more accurate calibration and validation of the model, moving away from reliance solely on reported (and potentially inaccurate/underreported) incidents. Satellite data could also potentially inform on factors like vessel activity (though AIS is already used, satellite-based vessel detection could complement it) and environmental conditions influencing spill drift."

The EMODNET data were combined into a single ASCII dataset and re-projected to ETRS 1989 LAEA. 4. These EMODNET data were then re-sampled to match the SYMPHONY 250 m grid using the resample function in ArcGIS 10 (bicubic interpolation setting). 5. The BSBD data were also up sampled to 250m grid by inserting nodes using a spline function. 6. A difference grid was calculated where the two grids overlapped. Since the BSBD grid was the source for the EMODNET grid it was deemed to be of higher quality for the overlap areas, except a relatively small area on the\nNorwegian/Swedish border which was masked due to\nobvious interpolation problems in the BSBD grid.\n7. Simple kriging was used to extrapolate the differences\nbetween the grids to achieve a smooth transition in the edge\nzones between the BSBD grid and the EMODNET grid.\n8. The simple kriging raster from step 7 was combined with\nthe EMODNET data from step 4 and a conditional statement\nin ArcGIS was used to substitute the up sampled BSBD grid\n(step 5) so it would be used in preference.\n9. Interpolation: The stacked grid was interpolated using the\nelevation void fill function in ArcGIS to fill small gaps along\nthe shoreline (the shoreline used was produced for the\nSymphony project by the Geological Survey of Sweden (SGU)\nand in Sweden is primarily sourced from the Swedish\nmapping, cadastral and land registration authority’s\n(Läntmäteriet) 1:50000 vector shoreline “terrängkartan”\nwhich was downloaded on 29/01/2016.\n10. Higher resolution (between 15m and 300m) depth data\nfor Västra Götaland, Östergötland, Västerbotten,\nNorrbotten, Västernorrland, Skåne, Stockholm,\nSödermanland and Hanöbukten were provided by Aquabiota\nAB on behalf of Swedish Agency for Marine and Water\nManagement (SwAM). These data were created between\n2010 and 2016 using data provided by the Swedish Maritime\nAgency (SMA) using a mix of modern high resolution\nmultibeam data and legacy depth data from charts. Each\ndata grid was imported as a geoTIFF and combined and\nresampled to a 250 meter resolution geoTIFF using bicubic\nresampling in the ETRS 1989 LAEA coordinate reference\nsystem.\n11. Using the same method as described in step 6, a\ndifference grid was calculated between the new data and the\ncombined EMODNET/BSBD depth grid. This was exported\nat 250m resolution and simple kriging was used to\nextrapolate this difference grid at the edges (to produce a\nsmooth transition to zero difference between the grids).\n12. The depth grid from step 9 was combined with the simple\nkriging output (step 11) and the original high resolution grid\n(step 10).\n13. The final grid was exported as a geoTIFF\nThe depth grid is a compilation of two published publically\navailable bathymetry datasets and a number of currently\nunpublished but derestricted bathymetry datasets from\nnational sources. Interpolation techniques have been used to fill gaps between available data and the shoreline and to\nsmooth transitions between data from differing sources.\nThe two published international data sources are the Baltic\nSea Bathymetry Database (BSBD) which is a 500m grid\n(published in 2013 at http://data.bshc.pro/) and Emodnet\nBathymetry which is a one eighth arc minute grid -\napproximately 230m (published 2015 at\nhttp://portal.emodnet-bathymetry.eu/ ). It should be noted\nthat the true resolution of these bathymetric grids are\ndependent on the quality and resolution of the source data,\nfor example the Emodnet source in the Kattegat is a mix of\nGeneral Bathymetric Chart of the Ocean (GEBCO) data\n(approx. 1km grid) as well as higher resolution open data\nfrom Norwegian sea charts, while in the Baltic Sea the\nprimary source is the BSBD dataset (500m). Due to gridding\nartefacts discovered in the Emodnet dataset, the source\nBSBD data was used when available.\nFor coastal areas a number of declassified datasets produced\nby Aquabiota Water Research AB for the Swedish Agency for\nMarine and Water Management (SwAM) covering areas in\nVästra Götaland, Östergötland, Västerbotten, Norrbotten,\nVästernorrland, Skåne, Stockholm, Södermanland along\nwith data from Hanöbukten (from the project Marmoni) are\nalso included in the dataset. These data were originally\ngridded at a variety of spatial scales ranging from 15m to\n300m and were provided by SwAM. The data were re-\nsampled to match the Symphony grid (250m), and then\nintegrated with the underlying datasets (BSBD, Emodnet).",
    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": "The primary source for soundings used to create grid products in Swedish waters is the Swedish Maritime Authority (SMA). Their database contains both historical data and modern data (e.g. multibeam records) collected from a range of sources. Distribution of high resolution depth data from Swedish waters is heavily restricted by the military as well as subject to copyright. For this reason only publicly available and declassified data is included in this data product. All data have been re-sampled to 250m resolution to fit the Symphony standard grid template. The quality of the data varies significantly depending on the data source and age so in addition to the depth grid a dataset showing data quality is also provided. This has been compiled and interpreted from information provided by BSBD and Emodnet. Because of the gridding scale and dependence on multiple data sources of varying quality use of these data for local scale decision making may be inappropriate. Users are advised to determine this based on the data quality layer and to check with SGU or with the SMA if higher resolution data is required.",

The recommendation to use the updated EMODNET dataset, while beneficial, still relies on external updates and integration, which can be complex given the multi-source compilation process already described (13 steps). Integrating higher resolution, previously restricted data would require significant resource allocation, advanced technical expertise for processing diverse datasets, and extensive coordination with multiple stakeholders (SMA, military, EMODNET).",

While SDB may not replace high-resolution multibeam data for deeper areas or complex seafloor topography, it can provide valuable supplementary data for filling gaps, especially in areas where in-situ data is restricted or unavailable due to military or copyright limitations. It can also aid in validating existing shallow-water bathymetry or identifying areas requiring further in-situ surveys. The layer explicitly mentions 'filling small gaps along the shoreline' and 'interpolation techniques have been used to fill gaps between available data and the shoreline', which are areas where SDB can be particularly effective."

Kust (Swedish coastline to baseline), 3. HavExtend (ocean areas outside the Swedish EEZ that can be of interest), 4. HavExclude (Ocean areas that are outside the area of interest), 5. Land (all land areas). Since the location of the Swedish EEZ is pending this grid was created\nusing a combination of several EEZ versions which were combine to a\n'maximum area EEZ', this was to ensure that the principal area of interest\n(class 1, Hav) for SYMPHONY is covered.\nThe Swedish baseline was used to define the inner limit of the ocean\nplanning area to ensure overlap with the coastal planning area which\nextends one nautical mile outside the baseline.",
    "summary_swedish": "Detta rasterskikt är en standardgrid framställd av Sveriges geologiska undersökning (www.sgu.se) för det marina havsplaneringsverktyget Symphony, vilket för närvarande är under utveckling av Havs- och vattenmyndigheten (www.havochvatten.se). Rastret är baserat på en 250 meters grid som är kompatibel med den europeiska standardgriden (ETRS 89 LAEA) och består av 5 klasser: 1. Hav (svenska baslinjen till kanten av EEZ) 2. Kust (svenska kustlinjen till baslinjen) 3. HavExtend (havsområden utanför den svenska EEZ som kan vara av intresse) 4. HavExclude (havsområde utanför områden av intresse) 5. Land (alla landområden) Eftersom läget för den svenska EEZ inte är fastställd, skapades denna grid genom en kombination av flera EEZ-versioner vilket kombinerades till ”maximala områdes-EEZ”, detta gjordes för att säkerställa att huvudområdet av intresse (klass 1, Hav) för Symphony täcks. Den svenska baslinjen användes för att definiera inre begränsning av havsplaneringsområdet, för att säkerställa överlapp med kustplaneringsområdet vilket sträcker sig en nautisk mil utanför baslinjen.",

      "improvement_justification": "The primary limitation is that the Swedish EEZ is not finalized, leading to a 'maximum extents' EEZ in the current layer. The recommendation is to update the dataset once an EEZ is agreed upon. This fundamental update would significantly alter the 'Hav' (Class 1) and 'HavExtend' (Class 3) boundaries, which are core to the planning tool. A finalized EEZ would provide a legally binding and accurate spatial definition, moving from a 'maximum extent' approximation to a definitive boundary, thus representing a substantial improvement in the layer's foundational accuracy and utility for marine spatial planning.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvement (updating the EEZ) is contingent on a political and legal process (EEZ agreement), which is outside the direct control of the data producers. Once an agreement is reached, the technical task of updating the raster involves integrating new, definitive boundary data. This requires advanced technical expertise in GIS and data processing, but it's primarily a data integration task rather than new data collection or complex modeling. The 'medium' difficulty reflects the dependency on an external, non-technical process and the subsequent need for precise spatial data handling, rather than inherent technical complexity of the update itself.",
      "satellite_justification": "The core data for this layer defines administrative and legal boundaries (coastline, baseline, EEZ) and land/sea classifications. These are primarily derived from legal definitions, hydrographic charts, and land surveys. While satellite imagery can delineate coastlines or land areas, the precise legal baseline and EEZ boundaries are not directly observable or derivable from satellite remote sensing. Satellite data cannot determine the legal definition of an EEZ or a baseline, nor can it classify areas as 'Hav', 'Kust', 'HavExtend', 'HavExclude', or 'Land' based on legal or administrative criteria. Therefore, satellite remote sensing cannot generate or significantly improve the fundamental definitional aspects of this layer, which are based on agreed-upon legal and administrative boundaries."

    "summary": "These raster layers intend to show the predicted distribution of geological substrates in marine benthic sediments. The individual geological component classes include mud (gyttja), clay (lera), silt (silt), sand (sand), gravel (grus), cobbles (sten), boulders (block), and bedrock (berg). These individual components have been combined into three layers based on estimated grain size: 1) Softbottom - mud, clay, silt, 2) transport bottom sediments: sand and gravel, and 3) hard bottom - cobbles, boulders and exposed bedrock. A cell value of 100 is equivalent to high mean relative proportion of a seabed type and a cell value of 0 is equivalent to low mean relative proportion of a seabed type. Data are from several sources and consist of sediment sample data (SGU 1970- 2014) and categorical geological maps (Emodnet 2016 and\nSGU), and depth data (Symphony Depth Grid).",

    "lineage": "The data products are a reclassification of the 'best available' categorical geological maps covering Swedish waters and the best publicly available maps from surrounding countries. This geological map data combines the latest edition of Emodnet's geology maps (draft of Emodnet 2, downloaded June 2016 from project ftp) with higher resolution data from the Geological Survey of Sweden’s (SGU) geological maps (scales ranging from 1:25,000 to 1:1,000,000) and merges classes from several different classification schemes. In order to compile a best available thematic surface geology map product, the maps of the highest resolution and quality were clipped into a master shapefile, all raster layers attached to this metadata are based on this shapefile (unpublished due to military restrictions in some areas). This raster was combined with depth zone data (0-30 m, 30- 60 m, > 60 m) and sea basin data (The West Sea (Västerhavet), Baltic Sea proper, and the Bothnian Sea and Gulf of Bothnia) The reclassification of the thematic surface geology map product to the geological component classes mud (gyttja), clay (lera), silt (silt), sand (sand), gravel (grus), cobbles (sten), boulders (block), and bedrock (berg) was achieved by examining SGUs historical archive of approximately 7800 sediment samples (collected between 1970 and 2014) together with the available maps products. Geological component classes were defined according to the Swedish Geotechnical Society (SGF) scale which defines classes by sediment fraction dimensions. The exceptions were the classes mud (gyttja, refers to sediment containing organic matter) and bedrock (berg). The principle geological components were determined for each sediment sample (recorded as presence/absence data). Presence absence records were then transformed to relative proportions of geological components (%) e.g. if a sediment sample showed\nthe presence of the geological components mud and clay\nthen the sample received values of 50% mud and 50% clay\nand the remaining geological components were assigned\nvalues of 0%.\nSummary statistics (means) of the relative proportions (%)\nof geological components were calculated for each geological\nthematic class within each map scale (local 1:25000-\n1:250000 and regional >1:250000), depth zone (0-30 m, 30-\n60 m, >60 m), sea basin (The West Sea (Västerhavet), Baltic\nSea proper, and Bothnian Sea and Gulf of Bothnia) and\ncombination of these. If the mean within a subclass (i.e.\ngeological thematic class split by a combination of map scale,\ndepth zone, and sea basin) was calculated from less than 20\nsediment samples, or produced illogical results (based on\nexpert opinion), mean values from other subclasses within\nthat geological thematic class were used instead. If mean\nvalues from other subclasses did not stem from 20 sediment\nsamples or more then relative proportion values of\ngeological components from the corresponding EMODNET\ngeological thematic class in the same map scale, depth zone,\nand sea basin were used.\nAfter mean relative proportions values of geological\ncomponents had been calculated for combinations of each\nthematic class, depth zone, sea basin and map scale (local\n1:25 000 - 1:250 000 and regional >1:250 000), a spatial\njoin was made to connect relative mean proportion of\ngeological component values with the master shapefile\ncontaining the best available thematic maps. In the next step\n50 meter resolution raster maps where produced with the\nthematic information, as well as all sediment proportions.\nFinally this information was up sampled to 250m using the\nmean value of the 50 meter cells for all sediment proportion\nlayers.\nOnce the relative proportions of individual geological\ncomponents had been calculated they were combined into\nsoft (mud, clay, silt), transport (sand and gravel), and hard\n(cobbles, boulders, bedrock) seabed types.",

These three combined classes where the main result of this data series and SGU strongly recommends that users avoid doing detailed analyses on the individual geological components due to the uncertainties involved – see user limitations for\nmore details.\nThere are a number of additional key limitations users should be aware of when using this\ndataset:\n1) Only presence/absence data is available for sediment fractions in SGUs legacy sample\ninventory. Equal proportionality is assumed between the recorded sediment fractions but\nthis may be invalid.\n2) It was assumed that at least 20 replicates would be required to define the proportional\nmakeup of each sediment class (in each sea area / depth / mapscale) . However, a power\nanalysis was not undertaken to ensure sufficient sample availability for each surface\nsubstrate class and there is a significant range in replicate numbers between classes.\n3) Where insufficient sample replication occurred to enable classification by depth, sea area\nand map scale data were averaged across depth ranges and between sea areas so certain\nclasses are more reliable than others.\n4) Surface substrates which form a veneer cover a smaller area of the seabed and\nconsequently for some classes insufficient replicates were available for analysis. In this event\nthe underlying sediment class was used for reclassification instead. In some classes on larger\nscale maps this might cause veneered sediments to be depicted as mixed proportions of the\nunderlying substrate & veneer sediment fractions.",

The recommendations suggest sensitivity analysis, validation with empirical data (particle size analysis), expert review, and gathering additional source data from surrounding countries. Addressing these would require significant new data collection (e.g., actual particle size analysis, more replicates), fundamental changes to the proportionality assumption, and potentially re-modeling the entire classification process, leading to a substantial improvement in data reliability and accuracy.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended improvements would be highly difficult. It requires extensive new data collection (e.g., 'at least 20 replicates' for each subclass, empirical particle size analysis data for validation), which is resource-intensive and time-consuming. Validating proportionality assumptions would necessitate a major re-evaluation of the core methodology. Harmonizing data from surrounding countries implies complex international collaboration and data integration challenges. The need for 'expert review' and 'sensitivity analysis' also points to significant analytical and human resource requirements.",
      "satellite_justification": "This layer describes geological surface substrate, which is primarily determined by sediment composition and grain size. Satellite remote sensing, while excellent for surface phenomena (e.g., water quality, SST, coastal changes, some bathymetry in clear shallow waters), cannot directly measure or infer the detailed geological composition and grain size of benthic sediments. The data relies on sediment samples (SGU 1970-2014) and categorical geological maps, which are in-situ or derived from in-situ measurements. While satellite-derived bathymetry could potentially refine depth zones in some areas, it wouldn't address the core issues of sediment type classification, proportionality, or replication. Therefore, satellite data cannot effectively generate or significantly improve this specific layer's core content."

The interpretation is based on expert judgement using information on source data quality from the Geological Survey of Sweden (SGU). The data is classified into 5 classes:\n0,0.25, 0.5,0.75 and 1. A value of 1 refers to data gaps (no-\ndata), 0.75 refers to low quality modelled data, 0.5 refers to\nhigh quality modelled data without validation, 0.25 refers to\na high quality validated model and 0 refers to cells which\ncontain source data.",

Tolkningen bygger på expertbedömning med information om källkvalitetsdata från Svergies Geologiska Undersökningar (SGU). Uppgifterna är indelade i 5 klasser: 0,025, 0,5, 0,75 och 1. Ett värde av 1 avser datafelter (ingen data), 0,75 hänvisar till lågkvalitativa modellerade data, 0,5 avser högkvalitativa modellerade data utan validering, 0,25 hänvisar till en kvalitetsvaliderad modell och 0 avser celler som innehåller källdata.",
    "lineage": "These data were created by the Geological Survey of Sweden (SGU)and Emdonet Geology. The interpretation of quality for this dataset is based on map scale. SGU data are produced at four scales 1:20,000, 1:100,000 and 1:500,000 and 1:1,000,000. Emdonet data are produced at 1:100,000 and 1:500,000 scale. 1:20,000 scale data was scored 0.25 data at 1:100,000 is scored lower:: 0.5 and data >1:100,000 scale is scored 0.75. In areas with no data available (some coastal areas) the data are scored 1 (high uncertainty) 1) The footprint of maps from each scale were collated into polygon datasets in ArcGIS for the three quality levels. 2) These footprints were converted to rasters in ArcGIS (polygon to raster) 3) Each raster was then resampled (250m) and snapped to the Symphony Grid in ArcGIS 4) 1:20,000 scale data was scored as 0.25 (high quality model) using the reclassify tool in ArcGIS spatial analyst 5) 1:100,000 is scored 0.5 (high quality model without validation) using the reclassify tool in ArcGIS spatial analyst 6) Data >1:100,000 scale is scored 0.75 (low quality model) using the reclassify tool in ArcGIS spatial analyst 7) The layers from 4,5 and 6 were combined into a single raster using cell statistics in ArcGIS spatial analyst (MAX) 8) No data cells were scored 1 (High uncertainity: no-data)",
    "limitations_for_use_in_symphony": " Geological data quality depends on a range of factors including the survey method and\ncoverage, sampling intensity, positioning, analytical method and legacy (date) of the data.\nThis is not accounted for in the quality interpretation. In addition some data detailing\nsurvey data quality (particularly on older maps) are applied to the area of the map product\nand not the area covered by the survey data. This may therefore lead to overestimation of\nquality of these data.\nThis interprtation of quality only refers to the categorical map source data and not point\nsample data used to reinterpret these data. These data are also of varying quality and\ncoverage. This is not accounted for in the data quality map.",
    "recommendations_for_data_improvement": "An improved method for calculating data confidence was developed during the MESH (Mapping European Seabed Habitats) project in 2006 - this approach is now used as standard in Emodnet Geology products. It would be beneficial to revist the source data and update the quality maps building on this methodology. For example an allocation of confidence in the translation from sediment class to sediment proportions could also be esimated based on the availability of sediment data for that specific class translation combined with a kernal density analysis of available point samples. This could also be weighted based on knowledge of the quality (legacy and accuracy) of the samples.",

      "improvement_justification": "The recommendations explicitly suggest adopting a new, more sophisticated methodology (MESH project's approach, now standard in Emodnet Geology) for calculating data confidence. This involves not just updating existing data but fundamentally changing how quality is assessed, including estimating confidence in sediment class translation, kernel density analysis of point samples, and weighting by sample quality. This represents a significant overhaul of the quality assessment, moving beyond simple map scale to more nuanced factors, indicating large improvement potential.",
      "difficulty_justification": "Implementing the recommended MESH methodology would require advanced technical expertise (e.g., for kernel density analysis, confidence estimation for sediment class translation, and integrating various quality factors). It also implies substantial data re-evaluation and potentially new data integration (point samples, legacy data quality). While not requiring entirely new field surveys, it involves significant re-processing and methodological development, placing it in the medium difficulty category.",
      "satellite_justification": "The layer describes the uncertainty of 'Geological Surface Substrates'. While satellite remote sensing can contribute to mapping certain seabed characteristics (e.g., shallow water bathymetry, some habitat types in clear waters), the core data for geological surface substrates (sediment type, bedrock) primarily relies on in-situ measurements (e.g., grab samples, cores, acoustic surveys like multibeam echosounder for backscatter and bathymetry). The uncertainty assessment itself is based on source data quality and modeling approaches, not directly on observable surface features from space. Satellite data cannot effectively replace or directly improve the assessment of uncertainty for subsurface geological properties or the quality of legacy survey data."
