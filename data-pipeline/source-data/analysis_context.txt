IMPROVEMENT POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES
==========================================

SMALL IMPROVEMENT POTENTIAL - Consider when:
- Rich existing data infrastructure available (EMODnet, SMHI, SHARKweb have extensive coverage)
- Parameter is well-covered in catalogue (e.g., temperature, salinity, chlorophyll-a are abundant)
- Temporal gap exists but data sources are ongoing/active
- Format/metadata standardization needed
- Simple integration with existing monitoring programs possible

MEDIUM IMPROVEMENT POTENTIAL - Consider when:
- Some relevant data exists but coverage is patchy
- Multiple data sources need integration
- Methodology updates needed but established techniques exist
- Expanding geographic or temporal scope with available resources
- Bridging gaps between different measurement systems

LARGE IMPROVEMENT POTENTIAL - Consider when:
- Limited relevant data in catalogue for the parameter type
- Systematic data collection gaps exist
- New monitoring infrastructure needed
- Advanced modeling or data fusion techniques required
- Fundamental changes to data collection protocols needed

DIFFICULTY ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES
===============================

LOW DIFFICULTY - Consider when:
- Abundant in situ data available (72% of catalogue)
- Well-established monitoring programs exist (EMODnet, SMHI networks)
- Standard oceanographic parameters well-covered
- Data integration using existing platforms/formats
- Temporal updates from ongoing monitoring

MEDIUM DIFFICULTY - Consider when:
- Moderate coordination between organizations needed
- Model-based approaches required (10% of datasets use models)
- Cross-platform data integration needed
- Some new methodological development required
- Regional expansion within existing monitoring capabilities

HIGH DIFFICULTY - Consider when:
- Limited infrastructure for specific parameter types
- New monitoring networks needed
- Advanced technical expertise not readily available
- Significant resource investment required
- Novel measurement techniques or sensors needed

SENTINEL SATELLITE DATA APPLICABILITY (Copernicus Program)
=======================================================

Based on expert analysis from Jesper's Symphony metadata review, focus specifically on Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 capabilities:

HIGH SENTINEL POTENTIAL (true) - Consider when layer involves:

SENTINEL-2 APPLICATIONS (Optical, 10-60m resolution):
- Coastal infrastructure changes (harbours, marinas, buildings) - significant changes since 2010/2013
- Shallow water habitat mapping (photic zones) - underwater vegetation detection possible but harder with depth
- Ocean bottom type detection (mud, silt, clay, sand, gravel) in shallow waters via color signatures
- Photic zone edge mapping - detecting shade of blue where photic zone ends
- Artificial reef detection around wind turbines (coastal ones detectable)
- Shoreline vegetation mapping
- Coastal exploitation and habitat loss monitoring
- Angiosperms mapping (already proven with Sentinel-2A data)

SENTINEL-3 APPLICATIONS (Ocean/land monitoring):
- Sea Surface Temperature (SLSTR sensor) - proven ARD products available
- Ocean color and water quality monitoring (OLCI sensor) 
- Large oil spill detection (must be large enough for sensor resolution)
- Algae bloom detection and monitoring
- Climate change temperature analysis (Sea Surface Temperature)

SPECIFIC LAYER APPLICATIONS FROM EXPERT ANALYSIS:
- Anoxia background: YES if changes water color (surface phenomenon)
- Artificial reefs: YES for coastal wind turbines + reef modeling
- Bottom habitats (rough/hard/soft/transport): YES in photic zones, limited by depth
- Mussel reefs: YES for temperature data (Sentinel-3 SST)
- Climate change temperature: YES (Sentinel-3 SLSTR)
- Habitat loss coastal: YES for detecting changes since 2010/2013
- Dumping impacts: YES if significant enough to change bottom color
- Oil spills: YES for large spills (Sentinel-3 OLCI)
- Photic zone mapping: YES for edge detection via ocean color

LOW SENTINEL POTENTIAL (false) - Consider when layer involves:

DEPTH-LIMITED APPLICATIONS:
- Deep water processes (beyond photic zone detection limits)
- Subsurface phenomena not affecting surface color/temperature
- Small-scale features below sensor resolution limits

BIOLOGICAL/CHEMICAL LIMITATIONS:
- Species-specific distributions (birds, fish, marine mammals) - requires direct observation
- Detailed nutrient chemistry (nitrogen, phosphorus) - may require specialized sensors outside Copernicus
- Acidification measurement - limited satellite capability
- Fish farm impacts - unless large enough to cause color changes/algae blooms

TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS:
- Cloud cover dependency (Sentinel-2 optical sensors)
- Features too small for 10-60m resolution
- Non-surface phenomena
- Rapidly changing temporal processes requiring higher frequency than satellite revisit

CONTEXTUAL CONSIDERATIONS
========================

1. EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE STRENGTH:
   - Strong in situ monitoring network (364/504 datasets)
   - Good satellite coverage (27 dedicated satellite datasets)
   - Robust modeling capabilities (50 model-based datasets)
   - Well-established data sharing systems (EMODnet framework)

2. REGIONAL EXPERTISE:
   - Baltic Sea particularly well-monitored
   - Swedish institutions (SMHI, SHARKweb) provide extensive coverage
   - EU Copernicus program provides ongoing satellite data
   - HELCOM provides regional coordination framework

3. DATA AVAILABILITY REALITY CHECK:
   - 72% of available data comes from in situ systems
   - Only 5% from satellites (but growing rapidly)
   - Strong institutional data sharing culture
   - Mature quality control and standardization processes

4. RESOURCE CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Existing monitoring programs can often be leveraged
   - Data integration often more feasible than new collection
   - Regional cooperation frameworks already established
   - Technical expertise available through existing institutions

USE THIS CONTEXT TO:
- Calibrate improvement potential against actual data availability
- Assess difficulty based on existing infrastructure capabilities  
- Make realistic satellite applicability assessments
- Consider leveraging existing data streams rather than assuming new collection needed
