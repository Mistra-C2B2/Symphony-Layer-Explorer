These data are based on voluntary reporting and are therefore subject to observer bias. Areas without sightings are not reported and areas where many reports are made may be visited by multiple observers. As a consequence these data should be treated cautiously. A cell value of zero represents no reported observation of birds a cell value of 100 represents the maximum observed species diversity at the Beijershamn nature reserve in \u00d6land. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM).

    "Lineage": "National data on four species of seabirds (Velvet Scoter, Long tailed duck, Common Scoter, Common Eider) were sourced from the national seabird inventory (see: ORNIS SVECICA 26: 3-54, 2016) in the form of aerial line- inventories and point inventory data. These were used to calculate proportional population densities for defined inventory sectoral areas. For each species the observed abundance was divided by the survey area sector to produce areal abundance data. This areal abundance layer was then divided by the species' total population to give a proportional value relative to the species as a whole. The total populations used were: Common Eider: 515 000, Common Scoter: 412 000, Long-Tailed Duck: 1 482 000, Velvet Scoter: 373 000. Finally, data for each of the five species were aggregated into a single layer where the highest proportional value from any of these species was attributed to each sector. In order to capture the full spatial range of the seabirds including areas of peripheral importance this aggregated species density dataset was normalised using a transformation (lin100LogxLin01) and rescaled between 0 and 100 in ArcGIS. Consultation on the methodology has taken place between WSP, Lund University and the Swedish Agency for Water and Marine Management.",
    "LimitationsforuseinSymphony": "Note that the model is based on interpolation techniques and it does not predict densities significantly beyond the source data (for example using environmental data to infer distributions to unsurveyed areas). In order to attempt to make the data more conservative (i.e. precautionary) the data has been transformed to emphasise areas which have both core are peripheral importance. This approach might reduce some of the observer bias (by increasing the influence of unsurveyed areas) in the interpolation model but the result\nshould be considered to be a conservative estimate of species density.",

The source data are from aerial, shore and ship based surveys undertaken between 2007 and 2009 and these data were modelled (using a two step General Additive Model) to predict the species distribution both inside and outside surveyed areas based on environmental predictor variables.

    "Summary": "This raster intends to show the predicted risk of anoxia in marine benthic substrates in Sweden coastal and offshore waters. A value of 1 represents a high risk of anoxia (i.e. substrate with < 2 mg/L O2) and a value 0 represents a low risk of anoxia (i.e. substrate with > 6 mg/L O2). The layer is based on analysis and combination of a number of primary data sources. Sediment sample observational data (binary i.e. anoxic or oxic) from the Geological Survey of Sweden (SGU) has been combined with near bottom oxygen concentration measurements from in-water sampling and predicted levels from biochemical modelling from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI). Open depth data from the Swedish Maritime Administration is used as a spatial predictor, and shoreline complexity from the Swedish Land Survey is used as a predictor variable along the shoreline. Various secondary data sources are also used by SMHI in their biochemical modelling. This data is subject to a range of limitations and should be interpreted as an unvalidated benthic anoxia risk map. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the\nformulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other\npurposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data\nsources.",

In addition predictions of oxygen concentrations based on biochemical modelling were also available for the inshore environment and for the offshore environment for the Baltic, More information on SMHIs modelling can be found here: http://www.smhi.se/en/research/research- departments/oceanography/biogeochemical-modelling-1.31327 . SGU data was sourced from their data archive and covers the period 1993 to 2014. Data detailing anoxic or oxic substrate conditions is determined from visual methods, more details of the data collection method can be found in the combined SGU SMHI report from 2008 http://www.smhi.se/polopoly_fs/1.1975!/oceanografi_95%5B1%5D.pdf The data processing followed the following steps: 1. Interpolation of SGU samples using an inverse distance weighting\nalgorithm\n2. Merging of SMHIs inshore model, offshore model for the Baltic and\ninterpolated measurement data using an overlay approach (mosaic) in\nthe order mentioned.\n3. Combination of the SGU interpolation and the SMHI models where\noverlapping using a Mean Average (assuming equal validity in models)\n4. Apply a spatial smoothing filter (mean average over 7km)\n5. Adjustment of the model to take into account a trend showing very\nlow anoxia risk in SGU samples in shallow water to 10m (globally) and\nan increasing risk to 70m in the Baltic Proper.\nThe steps above are described in more detail in a data processing log\ncreated by SGU and provided to SWAM.

    "LimitationsforuseinSymphony": "This dataset is created from models based on water column source data from two different time periods (1993-2014 and 1960-2014) and historical sediment data (1950-2014). There is significant temporal variability (both annual and decadal) in oxygen conditions which are not represented in this data product. We combine all the available data with the intention of showing maximum spatial extent of annual average sediment anoxia over the range of all input data (1950-2014). The modelled data from SMHI lack spatial resolution inshore so depth is used as a proxy based on a observed trend of increasing sediment anoxia with depth in SGU's sediment records. Anoxia is also assumed to increase in areas with complex shorelines (due to decreased currents) but there is no data available to confirm this trend.",
    "Recommendationsfordataimprovement": "At present there is insufficient data with the descriptive resolution and spatial precision to produce an reliable (i.e. empirically validated) model of current (or even decadal annual average) sediment anoxia conditions. SGU now have an oxygen sensor attached to their camera system which is used to sample water column anoxia. We recommend collection of field sample data detailing oxygen content of the sediment samples along with nutrient and geophysical and geochemical conditions which could lead to a better understanding of the spatial dynamics and therefore enable the production of a spatial models which can use proxies (depth, sediment composition and water column data) to predict benthic conditions and which can be used for model validation. Autonomous field sampling (i.e. data nodes and landers) is a potential solution to better data as technology improves. https://viewintotheblue.com/underwater-science-nodes",

The data were normalised on a linear scale for each plan area so a cell value of 100 on the West coast (North Sea) plan area equates to 25 species whereas on the East coast (Baltic) plan area it equates to 12 species and in the Northern plan area (Bottniskaviken) it equates to 5 species.

    "Summary": "This raster layer intends to show the predicted abrasion of benthic substrates as a consequence of bottom trawling in Swedish coastal and offshore waters. Underlying data are from two sources and consist of Surface Area Ratio (SAR) of trawling (OSPAR 2009-2013, and HELCOM 2009-2015) data. A cell value of 0 is equivalent to no benthic abrasion by bottom trawling and a cell value of 100 is equivalent to abrasion (SAR \u2265 8.196288). The surface area ratios (SAR) of trawling are produced by summing total swept area of trawling within a measurement area and then normalize the swept area to the measurement area. Assuming that within the measurement area the trawling is evenly distributed the surface area ratio is interpreted as the number of times per unit of time the measurement area is trawled over. The swept area for a specific fishing vessel is estimated using modelled trawl door spread (for a specific fishery/gear) multiplied by the vms (vessel monitoring system) speed and vms ping interval for a vms signal/position representing benthic trawling. The total swept area within a measurement area is then the sum of all swept area positions, from all vessels within a measurement area. For these data a logarithmic relationship between trawl intensity SAR and benthic impact due to abrasion is assumed, however habitat specific susceptibility to trawling is not modelled so this is a simplistic assumption. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",

    "Lineage": "Data are internationally collected data on bottom trawling impact produced by the ICES working group on spatial fisheries data (ICES WGSFD). Standardized products on surface area ratio (SAR) of trawling were downloaded from the working group link on ICES homepage. The method is described in the working group reports (ICES Working Group Spatial Fisheries Data report 2016), but in short the SAR of trawling are produced by summing total swept area of trawling within a measurement area and then normalize the swept area to the measurement area. Assuming that within the measurement area the trawling is evenly distributed the SAR is interpreted as the number of times per unit of time the measurement area is trawled over. The swept area for a specific fishing vessel is estimated using modelled trawl door spread (for a specific fishery/gear) multiplied by the vms speed and vms ping interval for a vms signal/position representing fishery. The total swept area within a measurement area is then the sum of all swept area\npositions, from all vessels within a measurement area.\nThe underlying data has been aggregated yearly on a\ngeographic grid of resolution 0.05 degree (approximately 1.5\nx 3 nm square at 57 N). Yearly data on total SAR are\nproduced in the HELCOM (the Baltic including Kattegat)\nand OSPAR (North East Atlantic incl. Kattegat) region\nrespectively. Data are available for the years 2009 \u2013 2013 in\nthe HELCOM region and 2009-2015 in the OSPAR region.\nData are available as spatial polygons.\nEach year\u2019s polygon dataset were projected into the\nSymphony projection ETRS1989 LAEA. Further the\npolygons were rasterized on the symphony grid using mean\nvalues if several polygons overlay the same raster grid cell.\nAverages of SAR values are calculated (introducing zero\nvalues in NA raster cells) over the time periods (2009-2015\nfor OSPAR and 2009-2013 for HELCOM) and the Kattegat\narea where masked from the HELCOM data set. Finally the\ntwo data sets were added and save as\n'Bottom_trawling_intensity_mean_SAR.tif'\nThe raster was normalized by dividing the data set by the\nmaximum SAR value in the Swedish exclusive economic\nzone (EEZ): maxEEZ SAR = 8.196288\nFrom this underlying data set, representing swept area of\nbottom trawlers, a logarithmic response proxy was derived\nrepresenting sedimentation impact from trawling and these\ndata were rescaled on a 0-1 scale.\nUncertainty of this layer is set to 0.5 representing a \u201cgood\u201d\nmodel, in the whole region as the data are almost complete\ninternational data (representing vessels >12 m), they are\naverages over several years and thus represent a large part of\nthe total trawling effort and resource outtake but aggregated\ninto larger cells (0.05 degree resolution) and partly\nvalidated. Also compared to traditional proxies for bottom\ntrawling like kW*fishing hours, the SAR values takes into\naccount typical trawl widths for different fishing fleets.",
    "LimitationsforuseinSymphony": "This bottom impact layer aims to describe the impact of bottom trawling on benthic habitats. This bottom-trawling index is used as a proxy for this impact and a logarithmic relationship between trawl intensity and benthic impact is used. This a is simplified assumption - habitat specific susceptibility to trawling is not modelled.",
    "Recommendationsfordataimprovement": "The source data for Symphony should continue to be based on international data. Work should continue to increase the availability of data volumes collected today by ICES within WGSFD. Current available data is not divided into pelagic / demersal species. Official landing statistics per ICES box could be used to weight trawl index for catches per box and,\nfor example, per demersal / pelagic target species.\nNew research (Benthis - 7th Framework Program and Trawling - Best Practice Project) is\ncurrently underway to develop indicators for use in, inter alia, the Marine Directive. These\nproposed indicators are based on a mechanistic link between trawl intensity and habitat\nspecific benthic responses. This are therefore different from previous expert-based\nsensitivity estimates and the benefits of these kind of data have been highlighted in ICES\nadvice. The indicator data being created in the Benthis project will have the advantage of\nbeing normalized to the interval [0.1] and will therefore be suitable for future Symphony\nupdates.\nWork is also ongoing to include not only the direct physical impact (abrasion/mechanical\ndamage) but also sedimentation. Future data products should, if possible, consist of the\ninternationally produced indicators. In order to improve these indicators, it is primarily\nknowledge about habitats and bottom type that should be improved - funding support for\nparticipation in any research and development projects that would help to continue this\ndevelopment are recommended.",

    "Lineage": "This dataset was created by combining a range of seabed complexity metrics which were calculated in ArcGIS (with the spatial analyst extension) on a 10m resolution depth model maintained by the Swedish Maritime Agency (SMA). The indata to this analysis are from a 'best available' 10m resolution depth grid known as DIS (depth information system). Although the data are gridded to 10m the it is important to be aware that the input data are of highly varying quality. Refer to the associated map of spatial uncertainty for this layer to understand where major data gaps exist. DIS contains data which can be categorised into three quality classes. The highest quality data are collected using from modern techniques (for example multibeam echosounder surveys) and provide full coverage depth data (this is mostly restricted to shipping lanes), these data are charted to international standards (IHO S-44). The second category of data are those collected using modern techniques but which do not comply with international charting standards (although are still very high resolution for our intended use), they are data collected after 1987 (and therefore have a good positional accuracy) but they may not provide 100% coverage of the seafloor. The final, lower quality class of data are those collected before 1987 from historical chart archives based on data collected using older methods (e.g. single beam echosounders or lead-line surveys). In all classes of data it should be noted that depths may also be subject to a shoal-bias (reduced depths) which is standard practice for reducing potential collision risk in navigational charting. Due to mixing data resolutions data artefacts are likely to be present in the grid at boundaries between high resolution and low resolution surveys. The procedure used to produce the complexity datasets for Symphony were as follows: A) 6 complexity metrics and a hillshade were calculated:\n1. Bathymetric Positioning Index (BPI) with an inner\ndiameter of 10m & outer diameter of 250m,\n2. Bathymetric Positioning Index with ID:10m & OD:50m:\nhttps://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/tools/btm.html\n3. Slope using a 10m grid with ArcGIS spatial analyst.\n4. Slope using a 250m grid (downsampled from the 10m\ngrid) with ArcGIS spatial analyst.\n5. Standard deviation of depth using a neighborhood size of\n5 cells (50m) and the 10m grid with ArcGIS spatial analyst.\n6. Standard deviation of depth using a neighborhood size of\n25cell (250m) and the 10m grid with ArcGIS spatial analyst.\n7. A hillshade layer for visual interpretation\nData were generated using a ArcGIS modelbuilder toolbox\ndeveloped by SGU, and executed by SMA.\nB) All 6 complexity metrics where resampled to a 50m raster\n(mean value) using ArcGIS\nC) BPI metrics (1. and 2.) were stretched using an e log (base\n2,718) function and rescaled between 0 and 10.\nD) Slope and standard deviation metrics were also stretched\nusing an e log function and rescaled between 0 and 10.\nE) A average (MEAN) raster was calcultated by combining\nall the stretched and rescaled metrics from (C & D) .\nF) Raster values between 2.5 and 7.5 in the raster (E) were\nrescaled between 0 and 10 normalising the data to reflect\nhardbottom features.\nG) The resulting dataset was then downsampled from 50m\nto 300m using the maximum value in a 6x6 cell\nneighbourhood.\nH) The result (G) was standardised to the Symphony grid\n250m (nearest neighbour) with no-data set to zero.\nI) The result (H) was normalised by substrating the\nSymphony hardbottom dataset and the result rescaled\nbetween 0 and 100.\nJ) The result (I) was split into 3 depth zones photic, and\naphotic below & aphotic above 60m",
    "LimitationsforuseinSymphony": "There are some key limitations to be aware of when using these data: 1) Although this data product is based on the best available depth data - these depth data are of variable quality. In some areas there are even no data available: for example the area around Bratten Bohusl\u00e4n coast. For further information on depth data uncertainty refer to\nthe confidence map associated with this dataset.\n2) The model is based on data with a minimum mapping unit of 50m. This is not detailed\nenough to pick out smaller depth / morphology variations and a consequence the dataset\nmay not help in the identification of certain geological features (e.g. sparse boulders on a flat\nlandscape) which may be important or sensitive habitat.\n3) This dataset is intended to be used as a proxy for hard bottom bethic habitat (i.e.\nidentifying areas where SGUs geological survey data are unavailable) however this refers to\nmorphological complexity (and light penetration) and does not consider geological\nsubstrate. Therefore areas which are 'complex' in terms of morphology may not always be\nhard bottom.\n4) Normalisation to reflect 'hard bottom' features was undertaken by visual comparison with\nSymphony 'hard bottom' data - i.e. derived from SGUs geological maps. However, a perfect\nmatch between complexity and hardbottom is not possible using expert judgement.\n5) These data are currently only available for Sweden.",
    "Recommendationsfordataimprovement": "Further data collection is requied in areas with no data or low quality data. Rather than using two separate habitat proxy datasets in Symphony - morphological complexity (modelled from depth) and hardbottom (modelled from geological maps) the data on complexity should instead be used to drive a predictive model of substrate in combination with other physical predictor variables (such as currents & wave exposure) and ground validation data from point obserations. This work is in progress at SGU. This approach demonstrates a great deal of potential for improvement of national geological datasets. It is therefore reccomended that the approach is extended to surrounding countries (perhaps via international collaboration projects like Emodnet).",

    "Lineage": "This dataset was created by combining a range of seabed complexity metrics which were calculated in ArcGIS (with the spatial analyst extension) on a 10m resolution depth model maintained by the Swedish Maritime Agency (SMA). The indata to this analysis are from a 'best available' 10m resolution depth grid known as DIS (depth information system). Although the data are gridded to 10m the it is important to be aware that the input data are of highly varying quality. Refer to the associated map of spatial uncertainty for this layer to understand where major data gaps exist. DIS contains data which can be categorised into three quality classes. The highest quality data are collected using from modern techniques (for example multibeam echosounder surveys) and provide full coverage depth data (this is mostly restricted to shipping lanes), these data are charted to international standards (IHO S-44). The second category of data are those collected using modern techniques but which do not comply with international charting standards (although are still very high resolution for our\nintended use), they are data collected after 1987 (and\ntherefore have a good positional accuracy) but they may not\nprovide 100% coverage of the seafloor. The final, lower\nquality class of data are those collected before 1987 from\nhistorical chart archives based on data collected using older\nmethods (e.g. single beam echosounders or lead-line\nsurveys). In all classes of data it should be noted that depths\nmay also be subject to a shoal-bias (reduced depths) which is\nstandard practice for reducing potential collision risk in\nnavigational charting. Due to mixing data resolutions data\nartefacts are likely to be present in the grid at boundaries\nbetween high resolution and low resolution surveys.\nThe procedure used to produce the complexity datasets for\nSymphony were as follows:\nA) 6 complexity metrics and a hillshade were calculated:\n1.

    "LimitationsforuseinSymphony": "There are some key limitations to be aware of when using these data: 1) Although this data product is based on the best available depth data - these depth data are of variable quality. In some areas there are even no data available: for example the area around Bratten Bohusl\u00e4n coast. For further information on depth data uncertainty refer to the confidence map associated with this dataset. 2) The model is based on data with a minimum mapping unit of 50m. This is not detailed enough to pick out smaller depth / morphology variations and a consequence the dataset may not help in the identification of certain geological features (e.g. sparse boulders on a flat landscape) which may be important or sensitive habitat. 3) This dataset is intended to be used as a proxy for hard bottom bethic habitat (i.e. identifying areas where SGUs geological survey data are unavailable) however this refers to morphological complexity (and light penetration) and does not consider geological substrate. Therefore areas which are 'complex' in terms of morphology may not always be hard bottom. 4) Normalisation to reflect 'hard bottom' features was undertaken by visual comparison with Symphony 'hard bottom' data - i.e. derived from SGUs geological maps. However, a perfect match between complexity and hardbottom is not possible using expert judgement. 5) These data are currently only available for Sweden.",
    "Recommendationsfordataimprovement": "Further data collection is requied in areas with no data or low quality data. Rather than using two separate habitat proxy datasets in Symphony - morphological complexity (modelled from depth) and hardbottom (modelled from geological maps) the data on complexity should instead be used to drive a predictive model of substrate in combination with other physical predictor variables (such as currents & wave exposure) and ground validation data from point obserations. This work is in progress at SGU. This approach demonstrates a great deal of potential for improvement of national geological datasets. It is therefore reccomended that the approach is extended to surrounding countries (perhaps via international collaboration projects like Emodnet).",

Various tools and internal developed models were used in ArcMap 10.3 to produce the final data such as Dissolve, Point to Raster, Polygon to Raster, Raster calculator and Water Ways model 1.02 (Aquabiota AB model). The method is a simple GIS-model that aims to extrapolate lophelia and porifera distributions based on presence point density and distance between point through water ways. This model does not take into account any environmental variables The model groups presence samples if they are within 1500 m distance through water ways and therefore the entire buffered grouped area becomes an expected distribution area. Expected distribution area is represented with value 100 in raster file. Another condition is needed to be fulfilled to form an expected lophelia distribution area which is the samples density need to be three or more than three samples and they need to be at least 125 m away from each other. The radius 1500 m is selected based on average sampling spatial distribution across the Swedish water body and therefore it is most likely to group samples in a more considerable way than other radius distances. The second condition distance is selected based on cell size distance which is 250 m. It is set 125 m with the reason of being half of the cell size distance and therefore aims to eliminate points that might be on the same raster cell that could lead to a false creation of expected bivalvia distribution area. The samples density three or more than three is selected based on average sampling spatial distribution within the area with the radius 1500 m. All sampling points that do not fulfil those two conditions are represented as only one cell with the value 100. More detailed information on the lineage and methodology is available and can be supplied on request to the data owner.",
    "LimitationsforuseinSymphony": "This dataset does not predict or model the possible presence of deep reef or sponge communities it relies on observational data. This data is therefore likely to an underestimate the presence of these habitats (perhaps significantly) because these habitats are hard to detect (they cannot be identified with acoustic data) and there is very little survey effort in deep water offshore areas.",
    "Recommendationsfordataimprovement": "Based on available point data. Sampling efforts directed towards these species could improve the map, and possibly enable a more advanced modelling. If predictive modelling were to be attempted in future, better data on abiotic parameters (depth, water chemistry, currents and geology) data would be required to make reliable predictions - there are significant data gaps in the offshore environments on the West Coast of Sweden where these species are found. .",

The first is a predictive spatial model of areas with at least 10% cover of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) which utilises environmental data parameters to predict distribution in unsurveyed areas. The second is a simple spatial model of bivalve distribution based on observational data and proximity information. These two source datasets are binary data. They have been aggregated with a higher weight given to the bivalve dataset. A value of 0 in the combined dataset represents areas where no blue mussels are predicted and where no bivalve observations exist, a value of 100 represents areas where (or in close proximity to where) bivalves have been observed. A value of 30 represents areas where >10% cover of blue mussels are predicted (but where no observational data exists).

    "Lineage": "This layer was created by combining a predictive model of blue mussel distribution (mytilus edilus) with presence data of bivalves (including Macoma balthica, Cerastoderma glaucum, Arctica islandica, Modiolus modiolus). These data were combined by the SGU at the request of SwAM using a conditional statement in ArcGIS 10.3 Raster Calculator so that sites with observational records are given a value of 100 and sites with a prediction are given a value of 30. The first input layer for mytilus edulis was modelled using epibenthos data from SHARK (source: SMHI), where there are blue mussel observational records detailing % cover ranging from 0 to 100%. Data was divided into cover of <10% (0) and >=10% (1). This binary dataset was set to fit a presence-absence model (GAM, mgcv for R). This model used predictor variables including depth, sourced from biological records where available and completed with depth data from SwAM's Symphony depth dataset (source: Swedish Maritime Administration) where missing; Wave exposure: log(n+1)-transformed; bottom salinity (source: Emodnet Chemistry); benthic substrate from SwAM's\nSymphony geology data series: hardbotten_250m for the\neast coast and block_250m for the west coast (source:\nGeological Survey of Sweden). On the west coast a slope\nlayer calculated from the depth grid was also included in the\nmodel. The model was predicted using the same layers in\n250 m resolution. The cut-off in probability was set to 0.30\nfor the east coast and 0.10 for the west coast (the cut-off\nvalues are derived from the model and set to maximise the\nnumber of correctly classified presences and absences), so\nthat the cut-off value or higher is considered a presence and\nlower is considered an absence.\nThe second input layer showing sites with observations of\n'Bivalves' was created from \u201dMilj\u00f6\u00f6vervakning av Kn\u00e4haken\nmarina reservat 2011, Stina Bertilsson Vuksan och Peter\nG\u00f6ransson, Milj\u00f6f\u00f6rvaltningen i Helsingborgs stad\u201d and\nSHARKdata where the point data is represented as \"P\"\n(Presence). It includes all bivalves from the above sources\nsuch as Macoma balthica, Cerastoderma glaucum, Arctica\nislandica, Modiolus modiolus etc. Various tools and internal\ndeveloped models were used in ArcMap 10.3 to produce the\nfinal data such as Dissolve, Point to Raster, Polygon to\nRaster, Raster calculator and Water Ways model 1.02\n(Aquabiota AB's internally developed model).\nMore detailed information on the lineage and methodology\nis available and can be supplied on request to the data\nowner.",

Data processing took the following steps: 1. Using a script in the program NCO in Linux modelled [Chl-a] data were integrated by multiplying concentrations with respective weighted vectors and summing these to produce integrated chlorophyll-a concentration ([int Chl-a], mg/m2), after which mean [int Chl-a] values were calculated for summer, winter and the whole year. Median values and standard deviations were also calculated. 2. Average [int Chl-a] values were transferred to a SYMPHONY raster 3. Data were then normalised using a sigmoidal function to reduce the impact of extreme values",

A value of 0 is equivalent to a low probability of occurrence and a value of 1 is equivalent to a high probability of occurrence. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales. Re-use of these data for other purposes is only advisable with the guidance and advice of the data sources.",

    "LimitationsforuseinSymphony": "There are a number of key limitations users should be aware of when using this dataset: 1) Only presence/absence data is available for sediment fractions in SGUs legacy sample inventory. Equal proportionality is assumed between the recorded sediment fractions but this may be invalid. 2) It was assumed that at least 20 replicates would be required to define the proportional makeup of each sediment class (in each sea area / depth / mapscale) . However, a power analysis was not undertaken to ensure sufficient sample availability for each surface\nsubstrate class and there is a significant range in replicate numbers between classes.\n3) Where insufficient sample replication occurred to enable classification by depth, sea area\nand map scale data were averaged across depth ranges and between sea areas so certain\nclasses are more reliable than others.\n4) Surface substrates which form a veneer cover a smaller area of the seabed and\nconsequently for some classes insufficient replicates were available for analysis. In this event\nthe underlying sediment class was used for reclassification instead. In some classes on larger\nscale maps this might cause veneered sediments to be depicted as mixed proportions of the\nunderlying substrate & veneer sediment fractions.",

    "LimitationsforuseinSymphony": "There are a number of key limitations users should be aware of when using this dataset: 1) Only presence/absence data is available for sediment fractions in SGUs legacy sample inventory. Equal proportionality is assumed between the recorded sediment fractions but this may be invalid. 2) It was assumed that at least 20 replicates would be required to define the proportional makeup of each sediment class (in each sea area / depth / mapscale) . However, a power analysis was not undertaken to ensure sufficient sample availability for each surface substrate class and there is a significant range in replicate numbers between classes. 3) Where insufficient sample replication occured to enable classification by depth, sea area and map scale data were averaged across depth ranges and between sea areas so certain classes are more reliable than others. 4) Surface substrates which form a veneer cover a smaller area of the seabed and consequently for some classes insufficient replicates were available for analysis. In this event the underlying sediment class was used for reclassification instead. In some classes on larger scale maps this might cause veneered sediments to be depicted as mixed proportions of the underlying substrate & veneer sediment fractions.",
    "Recommendationsfordataimprovement": "Apply a sensitivity analysis approach to determine the overall consequence of misclassification. Review the approach to proportionality by validating the model predictions with empirical data (e.g. particle size analysis data). Undertake an expert review. Gather additional source data from surrounding countries to produce better harmonisation.",

    "Lineage": "These data were prepared primarily from acoustic monitoring data collected during the SAMBAH project between 2011 and 2013. The probability of encountering porpoises was calculated from measurements of sounds emitted from the animals. The study included animals in the Baltic Sea between \u00c5land and the Belt Sea (see method description in Static Acoustic Monitoring of the Baltic Harbor porpoise, SAMBAH, non-technical report http://www.sambah.org/Non-technical-report-v.-1.8.1.pdf). Summer and winter data were provided and these were combined (mean average) to produce an annual dataset for Symphony. The SAMBAH project (See SAMBAH Non- technical report) suggests a limit of the Baltic porpoise population. At this suggested demarcation line was therefore used to isolate the Baltic Population for separate treatment in Symphony. Data were extrapolated using an inverse distance weighting algorithmn to avoid a sharp break. Values were normalized between 0 - 100 using a linear transformation (where 100 represents the maximum value in the data). The were then resampled to a 250mx250m grid. More detailed information on the lineage and methodology is available and can be supplied on request to the data owner.",
    "LimitationsforuseinSymphony": "In avoid a sharp boundary the area between the Belt Sea population and the Baltic Sea population have been interpolated from the maximum value along the population limit proposed in the project SAMBAH (See SAMBAH Non-technical report) down to zero along an arbitrary limit at Bornholm. The demarcation generates a fictitious decline in the Baltic population in the west-southwest direction, which does not correspond to real conditions.",

In this scenario there is a rising radiative forcing pathway leading with human emissions resulting in a 8.5 watts per square meter output by 2100. This is a high global anthropogenic radiative forcing scenario.

The rasters were resample to the standard 250m symphony grid. For each model the difference between the baseline dataset and the modelled 2050 future was calculated and a single pH change dataset was created. The average of the ESM2G / ESM2M ocean oriented earth system model runs was used for the final product. The raster was then normalized (linear stretch) to values between 0 - 100 where maximum value 100 = 0.2 pH increase (the maximum average predicted increase).",
    "LimitationsforuseinSymphony": " NOAAs ocean acidification data is modelled at a global scale and as a consequence it does\nnot have a high spatial resolution (50km grid) and local hydrological and biophysical\nconditions are not factored into this model prediction (due to the high cost in computing\npower). This will significantly increase the model uncertainty.",

    "Lineage": "This data was created based on the assumption that dumping spoils with a different grain size will lead to habitat loss in the short term (although this is likely reversible). Two source datasets were used in the model. The location of licenced dredge disposal sites was provided by the Geological Survey of Sweden and this was in turn derived from data supplied by the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). The second dataset used was dominant sediment type derived from Helcom's 2006 Balance project. Each point location record was allocated the bottom substrate type derived from the sediment dataset using a spatial join and then each site was buffered by 200m. A comparison of the sediment type at each site and the nearest port was undertaken and differences between sediment types were used to guide a spatial selection of sites which are\nlikely to result in habitat loss.\nThese vector data were then translated to a binary raster file\nmatching the Symphony grid specification.",
    "LimitationsforuseinSymphony": "Metadata indicates that substrate data from HELCOM's 2006 Balance project was used rather than the updated substrate data produced by SGU for this project. The sites are buffered by 200m (note that this means some sites cover 1 cell and others 3 depending on the location of the point).",
    "Recommendationsfordataimprovement": "Data detailing the location sites licenced for dredge dumping sites is not well managed. The locations of dumpsites were updated to 2015 by SGU based on information provided by SwAM but no attribution for example detailing the quantities of sediment were available so it was not possible to model the relative impact at different sites. This could be improved in a future model iteration. There are currently some data on HELCOM's portal (HOLAS 2) and EMODNET human activities portal detailing dumping sites but little metadata is available.",

SEL from an explosion with a force equivalent to 263 kg TNT was then modelled from the Swedish Armed Forces\u2019 detonation practice areas. As information on the localisation of individual detonations was not available it was assumed that a detonation could occur at least once per year anywhere within the detonation practice areas. Values above the highest value (i.e. 216 dB re 1 uPa SEL) measured by Benda- Beckman et al., 2015 were used as the maximum value in the raster (i.e. cell value of 100). The resulting raster was linearly normalised with the minimum value (i.e. cell value 0) representing the threshold where injuries to porpoises are first observed (TTS of 164 dB re 1 uPa SEL) (Benda-Beckman et al., 2015). Results were time integrated using reports of historical (2015) number of explosions in permitted areas and assuming a weekly recovery time (thus 52 explosions per year genereates maximum score).

Processing was as follows: 1) Firing ranges were imported. 2) Coastal intersection points were calculated 3) Ranges split into 3 layers based on scale and shape - funnel shaped areas were assumed to be ranges that deploy artillery and were split into large - areas over 20,000m2, medium - between 20 and10,000km2 and small - under 5000km2. It was assumed that larger artillery are used in larger firing ranges. 3) Concentric ring buffers were generated from the centroid of the coastal intersection points. 4) Allocate a stepwise score with distance for large ranges 10 - 5km, 30 - 10km, 30 - 15km, 80 - 20km, 60 - 25km, 50 - 30km, 40 - 35km, 30 - 40km, 20 - 45km, 10 > 50km 5) Allocate a stepwise score with distance for medium ranges 10 - 2km, 30 - 4km, 30 - 6km, 80 - 8km, 60 - 10km, 50 - 12km, 40 - 14km, 30 - 16km, 20 - 18km, 10 > 20km 6) Allocate a stepwise score with distance for small ranges 10 - 0.5km, 30 - 1km, 30 - 1.5km, 80 - 2km, 60 - 2.5km, 50 - 3km, 40 - 3.5km, 30 - 4km, 20 - 4.5km, 10 > 5km Note - the spread of fire was assumed to be in an arc with the\ndominant area of impact fairly close but diminishing with\ndistance.\n7) All remaining areas (non funnel shaped) were assumed to\nbe areas with only small arms fire and therefore were\nallocated an impact score of 10\n8) All data layers were combined into a single raster layer\n9) A spatial filter was applied to blur the data (focal\nstatistics, 5km mean)\n10) Data were rescaled on a 0-100 scale and clipped to the\nSymphony Grid.",

    "Lineage": "Data were from the Swedish National Grid (SVK) and included a shape file of offshore wind farms. Data processing was as follows: The distance from the nearest wind power turbines was calculated using a buffer with a fixed distance (500, 1000, 1500, 2250 and 3000 m). The values were aggregated where \u201cthe highest value wins\u201d. There is no general rule that dictates distance for avoidance of wind power turbines by seabirds but is instead species and location specific. The lower limit of 3000 m is a theoretical impact distance for avoidance behaviour by seabirds that has been mentioned in environmental impact assessments (Ramb\u00f6ll, 2015). However, the literature does not demonstrate that a known avoidance occurs down to this distance (e.g. the so called synthesis report from Vindval, Green et al., 2011 specifies, as a rule, avoidance at less than 500 m and typically at approx. 100-200 m, with the exception of loons where reduced density has been demonstrated down to approx. 2km). Normalisation was linear\nwith respect to the areal impact, where areas outside of the\ntheoretical impact areas (i.e. > 3000 m) were assigned a cell value\nof 0 and areas within 500 m of wind power turbines were assigned\na cell value of 100. Discussion of the method occurred between\nWSP (consultant) and SWaM (client).\nMore detailed information on the lineage and methodology is\navailable and can be supplied on request to the data owner.",

It may also be important to note that avoidance studies often fail to describe the spatial scale of avoidance and they affected by weather and other behavioural factors. The height of the wind turbines are not included in this model. Mitigation of windfarm construction includes building higher turbines which can theoretically reduce the risk of collision (for some species) - see https://www.bto.org/sites/default/files/u28/downloads/Projects/Final_Report_SOSS02 _BTOReview.pdf.",

    "Lineage": "With the assistance of a generalised spreading model (RL = SL \u2013 TL) the Received Level (RL) of sound was calculated for all cells in the SYMPHONY at a frequency of 125 Hz. SL = Source level. Transmission loss (TL) was calculated as a function of the distance from the source (distance) as well as bottom substrate character at the source. For shallow (<30M) bottom with hard sediment character the function 15 \u00d7 log(distance) was used and for other conditions the function 20 \u00d7 log(distance) was used. Bottom substrate classification was based on maps of bottom substrate purpose produced by the Geological Survey of Sweden (SGU) for SYMPHONY. Bottom substrates where the proportion of soft bottom was > 50% were defined as having soft sediment character. The aggregated sound from all wind power turbines over a year were combined and converted to sound intensity. The yearly average was calculated and then converted to sound volume expressed in average decibels (dBavg), which was calculated as follows: dBavg =10 \u00d7 log10(\u2211\u2206t/T\u00d7(10)^((RL intensity/10)) summed over all \u2206t under the whole time period T (1 year alternatively 6 months). The source sound volume that was applied was 136 dB at a frequency of 127 Hz (integrated over the frequency range 123 \u2013 132 Hz), which was measured at Lillgrund as a conservative \u2018worst case\u2019 in the upper range for existing wind power turbines. The values for the wind power park at Middelgrunden, Bockstigen and Vindeby demonstrate source volumes < 136 dB (Miller, 2009, Underwater noise from three types of offshore wind turbines, Andersson et al, 2011, Vindval rapport 6436). A value of 114 dB at a one-third octave band centered on 125 Hz has been specified for Middelgrunden which further emphasises that the proposed value of 136 dB constitutes a conservative assumption for wind power turbine. Data were linear normalized between 100 and 150 dB yearly average. More detailed information on the lineage and methodology is available and can be supplied on request to the data owner.",
    "LimitationsforuseinSymphony": "Attention should be paid to the underlying quality and accuracy of the sediment substrate data. In particular the Geological Survey of Sweden (SGU) provided data on the probability of occurrence of soft sediment substrates for these modelling, these data are based on both on dominant grain size and categorical maps based on hydroacoustic data. The model does not include information on sediment compaction and morphology which will certainly affect sound propagation. This model should therefore be used with caution and should not be\nused for detailed studies of smaller areas.\nThe model should be used with caution outside Sweden within HavExtend, because there\nare modelled positions for the wind power plant and because the confidence in the substrate\ndata is lower.",
    "Recommendationsfordataimprovement": "s. Sound propagation models can be made considerably more complicated and \"heavy\". Modulated data has been checked against validated model for Lillgrund and there is a slight difference due to the use of generalized sound propagation factors. In the case of wind turbines, noise levels are low, which may mean that this minor error is not considered to be so important for the analysis in Symphony. Note that the noise relates only to wind turbines without masking or other effects. In reality, many other sounds occur in the ocean. If you want to develop the data set, you can develop a site-specific sound spread factor and turbine- specific source noise for each wind farm, but this is much more time-consuming and costly.",

The surface area ratios (SAR) of trawling are produced by summing total swept area of trawling within a measurement area and then normalize the swept area to the measurement area. Assuming that within the measurement area the trawling is evenly distributed the surface area ratio is interpreted as the number of times per unit of time the measurement area is trawled over. The swept area for a specific fishing vessel is estimated using modelled trawl door spread (for a specific fishery/gear) multiplied by the vms (vessel monitoring system) speed and vms ping interval for a vms signal/position representing benthic trawling.

    "Lineage": "Data are from pelagic trawling and seining are used as a proxy for outtake of pelagic fish resources. Due to lack of updated and reliable data on pelagic fishery from the ICES / HELCOM data produced by ICES WGSFD and total lack of pelagic data in the available ICES / OSPAR data set, two different unofficial data sets where used to produce the pelagic fishing layer. A one year (2014) AIS derived data set on international pelagic trawlers (OTM / PTM) from the Baltic including the Kattegat area were combined with Swedish logbook data from the Skagerrak area including purse seiners (PS) and pelagic trawlers (OTM / PTM). The AIS data set represented kW*hours aggregated on a 1 km x1 km grid. The Skagerrak data used where positioned (each fishing\nevent, i.e. trawl haul is reported to degree minute precision)\nlogbook reported fishing hours multiplied with engine size.\nThe data where aggregated on a 5 km x 5 km grid and\naverages over time period 2010-2015 where produced. The\nlarger scale is due to the lower spatial resolution of the\nlogbook information compared to the AIS data used in the\nBaltic. The pelagic trawling effort in the Skagerrak where\nthen raised to total effort per ICES statistical rectangle to\naccount for Danish pelagic fishing hours using official\nnumbers of trawling effort per ICES rectangle reported by\nthe EU. This procedure excluded seining as this is mainly a\ncoastal fishery to which Danish fishermen don\u2019t have access.\nFinally the Skagerrak layer was disaggregated to a 1 km x 1\nkm sized grid and added to the Baltic AIS layer.\nBefore normalization the OTM_1km_grid date where\ndisaggregated into the symphony grid (250 m x 250 m). The\nraster was normalized by dividing the data set by the\nmaximum trawler effort value in the Swedish exclusive\neconomic zone (EEZ):\nmaxEEZ trawler effort = 2103.768 kWh\nAfter normalizing data with maxEEZ all values >1 where set\nto 1.\nPelagic fishery outtake is assumed to be linearly proportional\nto the pelagic effort, expressed as kW*fishing hours. This\nrelationship is also assumed to be similar for seiners and\npelagic trawler.\nDespite the relatively high spatial resolution of data, the\nuncertainty of this layer is set to 0.75 representing a \u201cbad\u201d\nmodel, not validated.\nThe reason to place a higher uncertainty here compared to\nthe Bottom trawling is the fact that, only one year of data is\nused in the Baltic and the AIS data are not official positional\ndata (like VMS) coupled to logbook information on gear,\nm\u00e9tiers etc, several gears are combined using simple\nassumptions, different scales of the underlying data are\ncombined. Also the Skagerrak data are produce based on the\ntotal fishery in the area, assuming that the Danish fishery is\nlocated exactly where the Swedish vessels operate.",
    "LimitationsforuseinSymphony": "In the Baltic this data links AIS records (rather than VMS) of pelagic trawl activity to Swedish logbook (landings) data. Only one year of AIS records are used (from 2014). AIS are only required to be carried on vessels over 15m (in contrast to 12m for VMS) and the activity is only linked to Swedish catch data. This is corrected in the Skaggerak where there is significant Danish fleet activity in Swedish\nwaters by utilising ICES landing data. However, these ICES catch data in contrast have a\nsignificantly lower spatial resolution.\nIn the Kattegat no spatial data are utilised other than the logbook data (60x60nm).",

The impact of this limitation has been limited by incorporating an additional modelled layer into Symphony consisting of known / surveyed fiberbanks and fibre rich sediments as toxic areas (scoring 100) with a linear decrease within 10km distance however this is known to highly simplistic (in some areas there is very little heavy metal increase with distance) - it also ignores fiberbanks that have not been mapped. 2) The geostatistical interpolation method used does not take into account that land will act as a barrier. 3) The data is a historical average for all records in the ICES Dome and SGU databases and\nas such this may not reflect current sediment conditions.\n4) There is a lack of offshore samples so in general offshore areas have a much higher\nuncertainty.\n5) Data are combined based on their historical concentration and not their toxicity.",

In the 1960s and 1970s an estimated 23,000 barrels containing contaminated mercury waste were legally (at that time no regulation was in place) dumped in a deep water dumping site in aproximately 80m of water outside of Sundsvall in Northern Sweden. In 2006 the Geological Survey of Sweden undertook a survey of this dumping site and identified approximately 3500 barrels. This raster is modelled based on the positional data from that survey (the site and barrels in surrounding waters buffered by 1km) to provide an indication of the risk of mercury contamination. A value of 100 represents a high risk for high levels of organic and inorganic toxins in sediments and a value of 0 represents toxins at background level. Note that only 3500 barrels were found in the 2006 survey so there is uncertainty surrounding the location of the remaining barrels.

    "Summary": "This raster intends to show the predicted risk of inorganic toxin contamination in marine sediments as a consequence of historical mines laid in Swedish offshore waters. The underlying data shows areas which were mined during world war two as polygon data. This derived dataset makes the assumption that some sediment contamination may have resulted from this activity. A cell value of 100 represents a high risk for high levels of inorganic toxins in sediments, due to uncertainty associated with impact of mining activity these data are down weighted so a historical presence of a mined area will score 30 (i.e. low risk) and a value of 0 represents toxins at background level. These data were created as a data input layer for 'Symphony' tool developed by the marine planning unit at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM). Symphony is used by SwAM to assess the cumulative environmental impact of human activity in Swedish waters and this informs the formulation of policy at plan area scales.

The impact of this limitation has been limited by incorporating an additional modelled layer into Symphony consisting of known / surveyed fiberbanks and fibre rich sediments as toxic areas (scoring 100) with a linear decrease within 10km distance however this is known to highly simplistic (in some areas there is very little heavy metal increase with distance) - it\nalso ignores fiberbanks that have not been mapped.\n2) The geostatistical interpolation method used does not take into account that land will act\nas a barrier.\n3) The data is a historical average for all records in the ICES Dome and SGU databases and\nas such this may not reflect current sediment conditions.\n4) There is a lack of offshore samples so in general offshore areas have a much higher\nuncertainty.\n5) Data are combined based on their historical concentration and not their toxicity.",

    "Lineage": "The dataset is based on combined annual 2015 AIS vessel tracking data created by WSP for SWaM's Symphony project. Calculation of induced flow rate at the bottom is based on [Fuehrer M. and Romisch K. 1987. Propeller jet erosion and stability criteria for bottom protection of various constructions. PIANC, Bulletin No. 58.] Erosion has been assumed to occur at current velocities> = 0.3 m / s. Above the critical erosion level (0.3 m / s), erosion has been assumed linearly following the increasing induced flow velocity (closer to deeper propellers). Furthermore, a simplified assumption has been made where erosion increases linearly to the soft bottom / transport bottom portion within each cell of 250 x 250 m. Also, erosion increases linearly to the annual vessel frequency within each corresponding cell. Processing steps are as follows: 1. The combined proportion of the transport base and\nsoftbottom was calculated from the SGU basis\nSUBSTRATKARTOR_V1_SYMPHONY_20160919.\n2. AIS data on the vessel classes of tankers, passenger ships,\ncargo vessels in 2015 were pooled into one layer with the\ntotal vessel intensity per 250 x 250 m grid cell.\n3. Max speed (Vdmax) at a certain depth (d) was calculated\nwith the equation Vdmax = 10.565 * d-1. Where depth values\nwere collected from SGU\nDJUP_SYMPHONY_V2_20160919.\n4: The equation is based on a power function matched to the\nresults of calculations of Vdmax using the relationship set by\nFuehrer & Romisch (Fuehrer M. and Romisch K. 1987.\nPropeller jet erosion and stability criteria for bottom\nprotection of various constructions. PIANC, Bulletin No.\n58.).\nWhen calculating Vdmax, a standard vessel has been used\nfor which the following assumptions have been made:\nPropeller diameter: 7.5 m (no rudder).,Propeller location:\n4.15 m below water level, Rotation speed: 80 rpm\n(equivalent to about 14.5 knots), Vessel size: L 330 m, W\n50m, D 15 m, E (constant): 0.21 (applicable to ships without\nrudders), Thrust coefficient: 0.45 (chart for advance no J\n0.45) (MAN, Basic Principles of Ship Propulsion)\nAccording to Hjulstr\u00f6ms diagram, flow rates above 5 m / s\ncan move all types of sediments (up to blocks). Values above\n5 m / s are not relevant why a threshold was applied at 5 m /\ns (all values above the threshold were given value 5 m / s.\nErosion on semi-finite sediment bottoms can occur at\ninduced current velocities of about 0.3 m / s (wheel flow\ndiagram), why a lower threshold was placed at this flow rate.\n4. All components in the model affect the degree of erosion\nof bottom sediment, i.e.: intensity of vessel traffic,\nproportion of fine / half-sediment and deep-specific\npotential flow rate were pooled by multiplying.\n5. The final grid was normalized linearly between min 0 and\nmax 100\n\"",
    "LimitationsforuseinSymphony": "The model is constructed to predict vessel thrust velocities that are likely to cause erosion and this calculation is based on a set of simple assumptions. The first is that all vessels have the same characteristics, the second, that erosion is assumed to occur at current velocities> = 0.3 m / s. Thirdly, that above the critical erosion level (0.3 m / s), erosion linearly decreases with depth (i.e. increasing induced flow velocity closer to deeper propellers). Furthermore,\na simplified assumption has been made whereby erosion increases as the probability of soft\nbottom substrate increases and erosion increases linearly to the annual vessel frequency\nwithin each corresponding cell.\nThe substrate and depth datasets used are also subject to limitations which should be\ninvestigated in further detail.",
    "Recommendationsfordataimprovement": "The model could be further refined by adding addition criteria on vessel dimensions. Additional observational data could be collected to validate the model assumptions. The substrate dataset could be refined (for example consideration of the morphology of the substrate and compaction of sediments). Data on currents and exposure could be introduced (however it is assumed that the sediment data would be collinear). A more advanced form of modelling based (e.g. a GAM) might prove a different relationship between the different variables so this might be valuable to test.",

    "Lineage": "With the assistance of a generalised spreading model (RL = SL \u2013 TL) the Received Level (RL) of sound was calculated for all cells in the SYMPHONY area at two frequencies (125 Hz and 2000 Hz). SL = Source level. Transmission loss (TL) was calculated as a function of the distance from the source (distance) as well as bottom substrate character at the source. For shallow (<30m) bottoms with hard sediment character the function 15 \u00d7 log(distance) was used and for deep (>30m) bottom or soft sediment character the function 20 \u00d7 log(distance) was used. Bottom substrate classification was based on maps of bottom substrate purpose produced by the Geological Survey of Sweden (SGU) for SYMPHONY. Bottom substrates where the proportion of soft bottom was > 50% were defined as having soft sediment character. The aggregated sound from all ships within a particular ship class over a year were combined and converted to sound intensity. The yearly average was calculated and then converted to sound volume expressed in average decibels (dBavg), which was calculated as follows: dBavg = 10 \u00d7 log10(\u2211\u2206t/T\u00d7(10)^((RL intensity/10)) summed over all \u2206t under the whole time period T (1 year alternatively 6 months). Source sound volumes that were applied for different ship classes were as follows: 125 Hz Passenger ships \u2013 150 dB 125 Hz Cargo ships \u2013 180 dB 125 Hz Tanker ships \u2013 185 dB 2000 Hz Passenger ships \u2013 150 dB 2000 Hz Cargo ships \u2013 153 dB 2000 Hz Tanker ships \u2013 160 dB Data were linear normalized between 100 and 150 dB yearly average. Schematic source strengths for different ship types and frequency ranges have been determined by a literature study. In cases where source strengths of 1/3 octave band at 125 and 2000 Hz have not been identified, the closest value\nfound in the literature is used.\nMore detailed information on the lineage and methodology\nis available and can be supplied on request to the data\nowner.",
    "LimitationsforuseinSymphony": "The generalized sound propagation model is not externally validated so the results of the modelling should be interpreted with caution. Attention should be paid to the underlying quality and accuracy of the sediment substrate data. In particular the Geological Survey of Sweden (SGU) provided data on the probability of occurrence of soft sediment substrates for these modelling, these data are based on both on dominant grain size and categorical maps based on hydroacoustic data. The model does not include information on sediment compaction and morphology which will certainly affect sound propagation. This model should therefore be used with caution and should not be used for detailed studies of smaller areas.",
    "Recommendationsfordataimprovement": "Produce data on seabed geomorphology (e.g. depth metrics) and sediment compaction may be useful for improvement of the model At present little data is available for model validation so identification of additional sources of acoustic monitoring data would be useful.",

    "Lineage": "Lineage: With the assistance of a generalised spreading model (RL = SL \u2013 TL) the Received Level (RL) of sound was calculated for all cells in the SYMPHONY area at two frequencies (125 Hz and 2000 Hz). SL = Source level. Transmission loss (TL) was calculated as a function of the distance from the source (distance) as well as bottom substrate character at the source. For shallow (<30m) bottoms with hard sediment character the function 15 \u00d7 log(distance) was used and for deep (>30m) bottom or soft sediment character the function 20 \u00d7 log(distance) was used. Bottom substrate classification was based on maps of bottom substrate purpose produced by the Geological Survey of Sweden (SGU) for SYMPHONY. Bottom substrates where the proportion of soft bottom was > 50% were defined as having soft sediment character. The aggregated sound from all ships within a particular ship class over a year were combined and converted to sound intensity. The yearly average was calculated and then converted to sound volume expressed in average decibels (dBavg), which was calculated as follows: dBavg = 10 \u00d7 log10(\u2211\u2206t/T\u00d7(10)^((RL intensity/10)) summed over all \u2206t under the whole time period T (1 year alternatively 6 months). Source sound volumes that were applied for different ship classes were as follows: 125 Hz Passenger ships \u2013 150 dB 125 Hz Cargo ships \u2013 180 dB\n125 Hz Tanker ships \u2013 185 dB\n2000 Hz Passenger ships \u2013 150 dB\n2000 Hz Cargo ships \u2013 153 dB\n2000 Hz Tanker ships \u2013 160 dB\nData were linear normalized between 100 and 150 dB yearly\naverage. Schematic source strengths for different ship types\nand frequency ranges have been determined by a literature\nstudy. In cases where source strengths of 1/3 octave band at\n125 and 2000 Hz have not been identified, the closest value\nfound in the literature is used.\nMore detailed information on the lineage and methodology\nis available and can be supplied on request to the data\nowner.",
    "LimitationsforuseinSymphony": "The generalized sound propagation model is not externally validated so the results of the modelling should be interpreted with caution. Attention should be paid to the underlying quality and accuracy of the sediment substrate data. In particular the Geological Survey of Sweden (SGU) provided data on the probability of occurrence of soft sediment substrates for these modelling, these data are based on both on dominant grain size and categorical maps based on hydroacoustic data. The model does not include information on sediment compaction and morphology which will certainly affect sound propagation. This model should therefore be used with caution and should not be used for detailed studies of smaller areas.",
    "Recommendationsfordataimprovement": "Produce data on seabed geomorphology (e.g. depth metrics) and sediment compaction may be useful for improvement of the model At present little data is available for model validation so identification of fadditional sources of acoustic monitoring data would be useful.",

    "Lineage": "Based on data of ship traffic (AIS 2015) and detected oil spills (HELCOM, 2015, http://helcom.fi/baltic-sea- trends/data-maps/) the likelihood that an oil spill would occur in an area with a certain level of ship traffic intensity was established. The likelihood of an oil spill was calculated for 10 classes of ship traffic intensity. A focal statistics filter was applied on the generated raster to simulate areas that could be impacted by a spill. The impact area was estimated for an oil spill with a residence time of 24 h and a spreading distance equivalent to the distance that a spill can travel with a speed of 0.2 or 0.5 knots (i.e. two spreading scenarios with wind speeds of approx. 4.5 m/s and 8.5 m/s, in accordance with the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute\u2019s (SMHI) report 2007-8, Fairways in the Baltic Sea, Oil spill risk assessment). A sensitivity analysis was undertaken whereby detected spills moved a distance equivalent to that of the drift speed under 12h in a random direction. The sensitivity analysis indicated high sensitivity for the spills reported location. To simulate the oil spill weathering (i.e.\ndissolution, dilution, dispersion, sedimentation and\nevaporation) a linear decrease with respect to increasing\ndistance from the source cell was applied. Discussion on the\nmethod occurred between WSP (consultant) and SwAM\n(client) as well as Linnaeus University (expert).",
    "LimitationsforuseinSymphony": "The model used requires a connection between vessel intensity and likelihood of an oil spill but there are a number of other explanatory factors with great or greater relevance with are currently omitted. The sensitivity analysis indicated high sensitivity to the spill's reported location. The spill may have moved in the period between occurrence of the spill to the Coast Guard's discovery which introduces major uncertainties in the model. Data on seabirds killed by oil spills indicates that the actual amount of spills that are happening are likely to be greater than reported. This gives further uncertainty and implies that the model probably underestimates the likelihood. The probability that a spill enters the surrounding grid cell has been calculated by assuming a linear decrease with probability 0 at the distance reached during 24 h with a wind speed of 0.2 knots. The results should be interpreted as standard estimates.",
    "Recommendationsfordataimprovement": "There are insufficient data on actual spill occurrences so the model results should be interpreted with caution. These model could be significantly improved with higher rates of detection. It is unclear if reporting to the maritime authority is based on real time satellite data. Surface Aperture Radar (SAR) equipped satellite sensors are becoming increasingly capable of detecting spills. Further investigations should be undertaken to identify potential data gathering opportunities.",

    "Lineage": "The depth grid designed for use in the SYMPHONY framework is a compilation of two publicly available datasets: the Baltic Sea Bathymetry Database (BSBD) 500m grid (published in 2013 at http://data.bshc.pro/), EMODNET Bathymetry (published 2015 at http://portal.emodnet-bathymetry.eu/ ), as well as a number of declassified datasets produced by Aquabiota Water Research AB for the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM) (dnr 2749-16 including areas in V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland, \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland, V\u00e4sterbotten, Norrbotten, V\u00e4sternorrland, Sk\u00e5ne, Stockholm, S\u00f6dermanland as well as data from Han\u00f6bukten (from the project Marmoni). Data layers were produced as follows: 1. The 500m BSBD grid was downloaded as an ASCII grid from http://data.BSBD.pro/#3/57.90/19.98 on 01/09/2015 in the WGS 1984 geographic reference system. The dataset used was created on 06/09/2013. 2. EMODNET Bathymetry (grid C2, C3, D2) was downloaded from the EMODNET bathymetry portal http://portal.emodnet-bathymetry.eu/ as ASCII grids in the WGS84 geographic reference system on 16/05/2016. According to the EMODNET sites the last major release of this data was 08/09/2015 and this was based on updated GEBCO http://www.gebco.net/ bathymetry from 2014. 3. The EMODNET data were combined into a single ASCII dataset and re-projected to ETRS 1989 LAEA. 4. These EMODNET data were then re-sampled to match the SYMPHONY 250 m grid using the resample function in ArcGIS 10 (bicubic interpolation setting). 5. The BSBD data were also up sampled to 250m grid by inserting nodes using a spline function. 6. A difference grid was calculated where the two grids overlapped. Since the BSBD grid was the source for the EMODNET grid it was deemed to be of higher quality for the overlap areas, except a relatively small area on the\nNorwegian/Swedish border which was masked due to\nobvious interpolation problems in the BSBD grid.\n7. Simple kriging was used to extrapolate the differences\nbetween the grids to achieve a smooth transition in the edge\nzones between the BSBD grid and the EMODNET grid.\n8. The simple kriging raster from step 7 was combined with\nthe EMODNET data from step 4 and a conditional statement\nin ArcGIS was used to substitute the up sampled BSBD grid\n(step 5) so it would be used in preference.\n9. Interpolation: The stacked grid was interpolated using the\nelevation void fill function in ArcGIS to fill small gaps along\nthe shoreline (the shoreline used was produced for the\nSymphony project by the Geological Survey of Sweden (SGU)\nand in Sweden is primarily sourced from the Swedish\nmapping, cadastral and land registration authority\u2019s\n(L\u00e4ntm\u00e4teriet) 1:50000 vector shoreline \u201cterr\u00e4ngkartan\u201d\nwhich was downloaded on 29/01/2016.\n10. Higher resolution (between 15m and 300m) depth data\nfor V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland, \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland, V\u00e4sterbotten,\nNorrbotten, V\u00e4sternorrland, Sk\u00e5ne, Stockholm,\nS\u00f6dermanland and Han\u00f6bukten were provided by Aquabiota\nAB on behalf of Swedish Agency for Marine and Water\nManagement (SwAM). These data were created between\n2010 and 2016 using data provided by the Swedish Maritime\nAgency (SMA) using a mix of modern high resolution\nmultibeam data and legacy depth data from charts. Each\ndata grid was imported as a geoTIFF and combined and\nresampled to a 250 meter resolution geoTIFF using bicubic\nresampling in the ETRS 1989 LAEA coordinate reference\nsystem.\n11. Using the same method as described in step 6, a\ndifference grid was calculated between the new data and the\ncombined EMODNET/BSBD depth grid. This was exported\nat 250m resolution and simple kriging was used to\nextrapolate this difference grid at the edges (to produce a\nsmooth transition to zero difference between the grids).\n12. The depth grid from step 9 was combined with the simple\nkriging output (step 11) and the original high resolution grid\n(step 10).\n13. The final grid was exported as a geoTIFF\nThe depth grid is a compilation of two published publically\navailable bathymetry datasets and a number of currently\nunpublished but derestricted bathymetry datasets from\nnational sources. Interpolation techniques have been used to fill gaps between available data and the shoreline and to\nsmooth transitions between data from differing sources.\nThe two published international data sources are the Baltic\nSea Bathymetry Database (BSBD) which is a 500m grid\n(published in 2013 at http://data.bshc.pro/) and Emodnet\nBathymetry which is a one eighth arc minute grid -\napproximately 230m (published 2015 at\nhttp://portal.emodnet-bathymetry.eu/ ). It should be noted\nthat the true resolution of these bathymetric grids are\ndependent on the quality and resolution of the source data,\nfor example the Emodnet source in the Kattegat is a mix of\nGeneral Bathymetric Chart of the Ocean (GEBCO) data\n(approx. 1km grid) as well as higher resolution open data\nfrom Norwegian sea charts, while in the Baltic Sea the\nprimary source is the BSBD dataset (500m). Due to gridding\nartefacts discovered in the Emodnet dataset, the source\nBSBD data was used when available.\nFor coastal areas a number of declassified datasets produced\nby Aquabiota Water Research AB for the Swedish Agency for\nMarine and Water Management (SwAM) covering areas in\nV\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland, \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland, V\u00e4sterbotten, Norrbotten,\nV\u00e4sternorrland, Sk\u00e5ne, Stockholm, S\u00f6dermanland along\nwith data from Han\u00f6bukten (from the project Marmoni) are\nalso included in the dataset. These data were originally\ngridded at a variety of spatial scales ranging from 15m to\n300m and were provided by SwAM. The data were re-\nsampled to match the Symphony grid (250m), and then\nintegrated with the underlying datasets (BSBD, Emodnet).",
    "LimitationsforuseinSymphony": "The primary source for soundings used to create grid products in Swedish waters is the Swedish Maritime Authority (SMA). Their database contains both historical data and modern data (e.g. multibeam records) collected from a range of sources. Distribution of high resolution depth data from Swedish waters is heavily restricted by the military as well as subject to copyright. For this reason only publicly available and declassified data is included in this data product. All data have been re-sampled to 250m resolution to fit the Symphony standard grid template. The quality of the data varies significantly depending on the data source and age so in addition to the depth grid a dataset showing data quality is also provided. This has been compiled and interpreted from information provided by BSBD and Emodnet. Because of the gridding scale and dependence on multiple data sources of varying quality use of these data for local scale decision making may be inappropriate. Users are advised to determine this based on the data quality layer and to check with SGU or with the SMA if higher resolution data is required.",

    "Summary": "This raster is a standard grid developed by the Swedish geological survey (www.sgu.se) for a marine spatial planning tool known as SYMPHONY which is currently under development by Sweden's Agency for Marine and Water Management (www.havochvatten.se). The raster is based on a 250 meter grid compatible with the European standard grid (ETRS 89 LAEA) and contains 5 classes: 1. Hav (Swedish baseline to edge of the EEZ), 2. Kust (Swedish coastline to baseline), 3. HavExtend (ocean areas outside the Swedish EEZ that can be of interest), 4. HavExclude (Ocean areas that are outside the area of interest), 5. Land (all land areas). Since the location of the Swedish EEZ is pending this grid was created\nusing a combination of several EEZ versions which were combine to a\n'maximum area EEZ', this was to ensure that the principal area of interest\n(class 1, Hav) for SYMPHONY is covered.\nThe Swedish baseline was used to define the inner limit of the ocean\nplanning area to ensure overlap with the coastal planning area which\nextends one nautical mile outside the baseline.",

    "Summary": "These raster layers intend to show the predicted distribution of geological substrates in marine benthic sediments. The individual geological component classes include mud (gyttja), clay (lera), silt (silt), sand (sand), gravel (grus), cobbles (sten), boulders (block), and bedrock (berg). These individual components have been combined into three layers based on estimated grain size: 1) Softbottom - mud, clay, silt, 2) transport bottom sediments: sand and gravel, and 3) hard bottom - cobbles, boulders and exposed bedrock. A cell value of 100 is equivalent to high mean relative proportion of a seabed type and a cell value of 0 is equivalent to low mean relative proportion of a seabed type. Data are from several sources and consist of sediment sample data (SGU 1970- 2014) and categorical geological maps (Emodnet 2016 and\nSGU), and depth data (Symphony Depth Grid).",

    "Lineage": "The data products are a reclassification of the 'best available' categorical geological maps covering Swedish waters and the best publicly available maps from surrounding countries. This geological map data combines the latest edition of Emodnet's geology maps (draft of Emodnet 2, downloaded June 2016 from project ftp) with higher resolution data from the Geological Survey of Sweden\u2019s (SGU) geological maps (scales ranging from 1:25,000 to 1:1,000,000) and merges classes from several different classification schemes. In order to compile a best available thematic surface geology map product, the maps of the highest resolution and quality were clipped into a master shapefile, all raster layers attached to this metadata are based on this shapefile (unpublished due to military restrictions in some areas). This raster was combined with depth zone data (0-30 m, 30- 60 m, > 60 m) and sea basin data (The West Sea (V\u00e4sterhavet), Baltic Sea proper, and the Bothnian Sea and Gulf of Bothnia) The reclassification of the thematic surface geology map product to the geological component classes mud (gyttja), clay (lera), silt (silt), sand (sand), gravel (grus), cobbles (sten), boulders (block), and bedrock (berg) was achieved by examining SGUs historical archive of approximately 7800 sediment samples (collected between 1970 and 2014) together with the available maps products. Geological component classes were defined according to the Swedish Geotechnical Society (SGF) scale which defines classes by sediment fraction dimensions. The exceptions were the classes mud (gyttja, refers to sediment containing organic matter) and bedrock (berg). The principle geological components were determined for each sediment sample (recorded as presence/absence data). Presence absence records were then transformed to relative proportions of geological components (%) e.g. if a sediment sample showed\nthe presence of the geological components mud and clay\nthen the sample received values of 50% mud and 50% clay\nand the remaining geological components were assigned\nvalues of 0%.\nSummary statistics (means) of the relative proportions (%)\nof geological components were calculated for each geological\nthematic class within each map scale (local 1:25000-\n1:250000 and regional >1:250000), depth zone (0-30 m, 30-\n60 m, >60 m), sea basin (The West Sea (V\u00e4sterhavet), Baltic\nSea proper, and Bothnian Sea and Gulf of Bothnia) and\ncombination of these. If the mean within a subclass (i.e.\ngeological thematic class split by a combination of map scale,\ndepth zone, and sea basin) was calculated from less than 20\nsediment samples, or produced illogical results (based on\nexpert opinion), mean values from other subclasses within\nthat geological thematic class were used instead. If mean\nvalues from other subclasses did not stem from 20 sediment\nsamples or more then relative proportion values of\ngeological components from the corresponding EMODNET\ngeological thematic class in the same map scale, depth zone,\nand sea basin were used.\nAfter mean relative proportions values of geological\ncomponents had been calculated for combinations of each\nthematic class, depth zone, sea basin and map scale (local\n1:25 000 - 1:250 000 and regional >1:250 000), a spatial\njoin was made to connect relative mean proportion of\ngeological component values with the master shapefile\ncontaining the best available thematic maps. In the next step\n50 meter resolution raster maps where produced with the\nthematic information, as well as all sediment proportions.\nFinally this information was up sampled to 250m using the\nmean value of the 50 meter cells for all sediment proportion\nlayers.\nOnce the relative proportions of individual geological\ncomponents had been calculated they were combined into\nsoft (mud, clay, silt), transport (sand and gravel), and hard\n(cobbles, boulders, bedrock) seabed types.",
    "LimitationsforuseinSymphony": "Once the relative proportions of individual geological components had been calculated they were combined into soft (mud, clay, silt), transport (sand and gravel), and hard (cobbles, boulders, bedrock) seabed types. These three combined classes where the main result of this data series and SGU strongly recommends that users avoid doing detailed analyses on the individual geological components due to the uncertainties involved \u2013 see user limitations for\nmore details.\nThere are a number of additional key limitations users should be aware of when using this\ndataset:\n1) Only presence/absence data is available for sediment fractions in SGUs legacy sample\ninventory. Equal proportionality is assumed between the recorded sediment fractions but\nthis may be invalid.\n2) It was assumed that at least 20 replicates would be required to define the proportional\nmakeup of each sediment class (in each sea area / depth / mapscale) . However, a power\nanalysis was not undertaken to ensure sufficient sample availability for each surface\nsubstrate class and there is a significant range in replicate numbers between classes.\n3) Where insufficient sample replication occurred to enable classification by depth, sea area\nand map scale data were averaged across depth ranges and between sea areas so certain\nclasses are more reliable than others.\n4) Surface substrates which form a veneer cover a smaller area of the seabed and\nconsequently for some classes insufficient replicates were available for analysis. In this event\nthe underlying sediment class was used for reclassification instead. In some classes on larger\nscale maps this might cause veneered sediments to be depicted as mixed proportions of the\nunderlying substrate & veneer sediment fractions.",
    "Recommendationsfordataimprovement": "Apply a sensitivity analysis approach to determine the overall consequence of misclassification. Review the approach to proportionality by validating the model predictions with empirical data (e.g. particle size analysis data). Undertake an expert review.

For example an allocation of confidence in the translation from sediment class to sediment proportions could also be esimated based on the availability of sediment data for that specific class translation combined with a kernal density analysis of available point samples.
